<p>It was the last minute of play. The score stood
14 to 14. The teams of ’25 and ’26, the Freshman
and Sophomore classes of Pennington Institute,
were in a mad scramble on the gym. floor. It was
the last game of the interclass basketball tournament
and on the victory hung the school championship.
Both teams had severely trounced the
older teams of the Junior and Senior classes in a
series of three games each, and likewise they had
humbled each other, each class being credited
with a game. This one told the tale, and it had
been madly fought from the first whistle, as the
score, chalked on the blackboard above the heads
of the madly cheering crowd of students who
lined the gallery running track, attested.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the mêlée of flying arms and
legs, panting and perspiring bodies and tense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
almost grim, fighting faces on the gym. floor, shot
Thatcher, a Freshman forward, a clean-limbed,
black-haired boy of rather more than average
height. As if by signal from somewhere in the
crowd of milling players the ball shot upward
and forward and thumped into his hands. Just
a step behind him was Gould, the Sophomore
guard, slightly shorter, but stockier and as fast
as an antelope. His face was set with an unpleasant
expression of anger; there was that
about him that suggested a determination to win
whether by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>Thatcher dribbled the ball once, then poised
momentarily and lifted it for an overhead
shot at the basket for the winning two points.
Gould, in desperation, hurled himself forward,
tried to stop the shot, and, failing, fell to the
floor with a crash. The ball was describing a
graceful arc toward the back board from which
it caromed into the basket.</p>

<p>“Foul! He tripped me!” cried Gould as he
rolled over on the floor.</p>

<p>The referee’s whistle shrilled just as the ball
slipped through the basket, the cords playing a
crisp tattoo on its bulging leather sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>“Foul!” announced the referee. “Basket
void. Free shot for the Sophs.”</p>

<p>Thatcher, astonished at the sudden turn of the
incident, stood still under the basket for a moment
while Hoffman, the Sophomore captain,
swept down and gathered in the ball to take
it to the other end of the court for the free
shot to which the foul entitled him. Suddenly
the Freshman forward snapped into angry
action.</p>

<p>“Here! Wait! It’s a fake, Mr. Thomas. I
didn’t trip him. He fell purposely to make it
look like a foul. It was a trick, I tell you. I
didn’t touch him.”</p>

<p>“He did. He lies. He tripped me!” yelled
Gould, getting to his feet.</p>

<p>Thatcher looked at him coldly, and with the
utmost self possession spoke to him.</p>

<p>“You have the effrontery to stand there and
say that, Gould, when you know it isn’t true! I’m
surprised at your sportsmanship.”</p>

<p>Gould’s face grew livid under the sting of the
reproach.</p>

<p>“You lie,” he snorted, “you know you tripped
me. Didn’t he, Mr. Thomas?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The referee, surprised himself at the turn of
events, confessed:</p>

<p>“He fell, Thatcher, and it looked to me like an
ugly foul. That’s my decision.”</p>

<p>“I can’t blame you, Mr. Thomas, for he did
make it look real. He’s a good fakir. If I—”</p>

<p>Gould, enraged now, stepped in front of the
Freshman forward, and shaking his clenched fist
under Thatcher’s nose, roared:</p>

<p>“I’ll smash your face if—”</p>

<p>“Stop! Enough of that. Get off the floor, both
of you. You’re ruled out of the game. Hoffman,
shoot the basket,” snapped the referee, realizing
suddenly that he had already permitted matters
to go too far.</p>

<p>Hoffman toed the foul line, coolly lifted the ball,
took careful and accurate aim and shot it upward
and forward. The sphere went whirling prettily
through the air, thumped against the back board
and dropped neatly through the basket. The
referee’s whistle sounded. He reached for the
ball to carry it to the center again when the timekeeper
sounded his whistle and the game was
over. The score was 15 to 14 and the Sophomores
had won. Pandemonium reigned in the running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
track gallery where crowds of second year men
cheered and stamped and whistled to the consternation
of a big group of chagrined Freshmen.</p>

<p>Thatcher, who had lingered on the side line of
the court long enough to see Hoffman shoot the
basket and win the game, was joined by the four
other freshman players and two substitutes and
together they made their way to the spiral stairway
that led to the locker room in the basement.
No one spoke a word for some time until Buck
Hart, the captain and center, a second year man
but taking some Freshman work in class and thus
eligible for the “fresh” team, crossed over to
the bench on which Thatcher was sitting and
slipping an arm across his shoulder affectionately,
said:</p>

<p>“It’s a doggone shame, Jeff, but don’t you take
it too hard. You were playing to win, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was playing to win, but I wasn’t playing
dirty, Buck. And the worst of it is I believe
Mr. Thomas still thinks I tripped him, the dirty
fakir that he is.”</p>

<p>“Well—er—ah—he sure fell hard, Jeff. Didn’t
you have something to do with it?” asked Buck.</p>

<p>“What! Why, Buck, you wouldn’t think that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of me, would you?” exclaimed Thatcher, a look
of pained surprise on his face.</p>

<p>“Well—ah—it looked sort of rough to me. I
saw him go down and he was right in front of
you. Looked bad to me and I was surprised to
think <em>you</em> of any of us should foul so deliberately.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it, Buck, I didn’t. Oh, please believe
me, I had nothing to do with it. I never
have played dirty in my life and believe me I’m
not beginning now. It was he who played dirty.
It was a rotten trick. When he saw he couldn’t
stop the shot he threw himself down on the floor—fell
purposely and then howled that I had
tripped him. It was quick thinking on his part
all right, but dirty work. He saw that if he could
get away with it he would spoil my basket and
give his side a chance for a free shot to win the
game. And, thanks to his cleverness, it worked
out just the way he doped it.”</p>

<p>“Gee whizz, the dirty skate,” exclaimed Cas
Gorham, a sub, who had gathered around Jeff,
with the rest of the members of the team.</p>

<p>“Gould is a hard loser, I’ve found out. They
tell me last year in baseball he pulled some shady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
trick and—say—gee whizz—I forgot—this isn’t
the last you’ll have to do with Gould. He played
third base on the scrub team last year and he’s
got it doped out that he is naturally going to inherit
that position on the big team this year since
Squires graduated. And, by jingoes, that’s the
job you are going to try for.” It was Brownie
Davis who was speaking, one of the fellows who
had been instrumental in getting Thatcher to
come to Pennington.</p>

<p>“That’s my regular job. The position I played
best on the Y. M. C. A. team last year, you know,”
said Thatcher with a smile.</p>

<p>“Sure, we know. Don’t we all remember that
was one of the best amateur teams in the state?”
said Rabbit Warren, slapping Thatcher on the
back.</p>

<p>“Well, that will be your chance to square accounts
with him if you don’t get a chance before
that,” said Buck Hart. Then he added, “But
look out for him, Jeff. If he pulls that sort of
stuff he’s as crooked as a cruller. Keep your
eye on him. Coach Rice told me to-day he was
going to post notices for baseball candidates to
report in the gym. for cage practice in two or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
three weeks. We’ll be rooting for you, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I can keep him on the bench or
on the scrub team this year. I’ll try mighty hard
you bet. But even if I do win the job away from
him that won’t take the sting out of this defeat.
Honestly, fellows, I’m as sorry as the dickens
that I should be the cause of losing the game and
the school championship, even though I didn’t
play dirty myself.”</p>

<p>“Tut-tut, little one, don’t take it so hard,” said
Buck Hart sliding into his trousers. But it was
evident to Jeff that he was not the only one of
the team who took the defeat bitterly. All of the
fellows had played hard and clean to win and for
Thatcher to know that he had had the foul called
on him, even though it was not his fault, made
him feel deeply chagrined. Indeed, it made him
bitter toward Gould, who had played so unsportsmanlike,
and it made him so disconsolate and discouraged
that he had very little more to say in
the locker room, hurrying through the ceremony
of a cold shower, and dressing as swiftly as he
could and seeking his own room in Carter Hall,
where he flung himself into a chair and gave over
to bitter reflection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small>THE FIGHT IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The mood lasted. Jeff Thatcher said very little
as he went to the coat-room adjoining the dining
hall and discarded his street clothes for the white
coat of a waiter, for Thatcher earned a good portion
of his tuition expenses by waiting on one of
the scores of tables in the big student dining hall.</p>

<p>Usually he found a great deal of fun in his work
at the tables, for there was always a lot of good-natured
badinage and joking passed among the
fellows. But somehow this evening, as the students
filed into the big hall, he felt quite different
than ever before. It seemed to him that most
of them, and especially the Freshmen, looked
at him reproachfully, and about all of them there
seemed to be a suggestion of strained quietness
as he approached.</p>

<p>At first Thatcher could not account for it. But
suddenly he realized, with a sense of shock, that
they too believed that he had played unfairly,
that he had fouled Gould and that he had lost the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
game for his team by trying unsportsmanlike
tactics and being caught at it. He was loath to
think that this was true. He could not believe it
at first. But when in the lull between serving
students and clearing off the tables he stopped to
realize that even Buck Hart, the captain of the
team, and the other players as well had thought
that he was guilty of the offense, he understood
the rest of the fellows, some present as spectators
and hearing the referee’s decision, and
others getting the news by hearsay, could be of
the same opinion.</p>

<p>This hurt Thatcher more than he believed was
possible. Always he had taken great pride in the
fact that no one could question his sportsmanship.
He had played fair in the most desperate situations,
and he had preferred to lose rather than
resort to fouling, cheating or disobeying the rules
of the game. And now to have the fellows believe
that he had committed this offense hurt him to
the quick. How could they believe it? he asked
himself, how could they think that he would do
such a thing when they knew his record for clean
sportsmanship?</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher, like a tortoise, literally crawled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
into his shell; at least his sunny disposition did.
It vanished into the depths of his soul and he
became morose, almost sulky, which was far from
his normal attitude. Silently he served his table
to the end of the meal. Then, instead of joining
the rest of the squad of waiters at their special
tables which were set in the dining hall after the
rest of the students had departed, he hurried
away to the coat room and took off his white coat.</p>

<p>Attired once more in his street clothes, he hurried
to his room in Carter Hall and put on his
overcoat, determined to take a walk, he knew not
where, or do something to be alone with his unpleasant
thoughts.</p>

<p>Brooding over his misfortunes, he left Carter
Hall and started across the hard, frozen ground
of the campus. There was a suggestion of snow
in the air—a cold March snow, for the backbone
of winter had not been broken and for weeks
bitter weather had lingered with them. Snow
was in the air now and no doubt of it. Indeed,
as Jeff passed under an arc light at the bend in
the road that led behind the gymnasium building,
he noticed vagrant flakes floating down the shafts
of light. But he gave them small heed, and like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
a grumpy old turtle, which he felt he resembled
very much, he turned up the collar of his coat
and tramped on into the shadow of the gymnasium
building.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the blackness, two figures
loomed up. Thatcher, because he was thinking
and thinking hard, saw them only when he almost
collided with them. Not recognizing them he
tried to avoid them by going around them, but
one, the bigger of the two, stepped in front of
him again and growled in an ugly voice:</p>

<p>“You tried to make a liar out of me this afternoon,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Thatcher noted then that it was Gould, with a
Sophomore companion known as Birdie Pell.
He knew too from the odor on the breath of
Gould where they had been and why. Both had
been “out of bounds” to steal an after dinner
cigarette, a serious offense at Pennington and a
particularly serious offense in the case of Gould
who was a basketball and baseball man.</p>

<p>Thatcher stopped in his tracks and looked
Gould squarely in the eyes. His wrath was rising
steadily but he knew that he had it well within
control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Gould, I don’t have to try to make a liar out
of you. You are naturally one of that breed. As
for dirty playing, there isn’t anything dirtier
ever put on a basketball suit that has come to
my notice.”</p>

<p>Stung by this retort, and angry at being ridiculed
in front of Pell, Gould lost his temper completely.</p>

<p>“What’s that? You eat those words, Kid, or
I’ll jam ’em down your throat.”</p>

<p>He stepped forward pugnaciously and shook
his clenched fist under Thatcher’s nose.</p>

<p>Still surprisingly calm, Thatcher maintained
his position and calmly pushing Gould’s hand
aside, said coldly:</p>

<p>“Don’t wave that dirty thing in front of me that
way. Put it where it belongs. As for making
me eat anything, you aren’t big enough or man
enough to do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, you—you rotten Freshman. That
means fight,” said Gould, now losing himself
completely. He started to take off his overcoat.</p>

<p>Somehow Jeff Thatcher found great satisfaction
in the turn of events. The word <em>fight</em> had
a ring to it that brought joy to his soul. Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
he had not realized it, his mental condition was
such that nothing short of physical combat could
present a safety valve of sufficient capacity to
give vent to his feeling. Almost eagerly he
threw off his overcoat and dropped it to the
graveled drive.</p>

<p>It was a terrific fight while it lasted. All the
wrath and ugliness of Gould, the tricky one, the
conceited one, was pitted against the anger and
resentment of Jeff Thatcher, and from the moment
they squared off in front of each other it
was evident to frightened little Birdie Pell, the
sole witness to the historic affair, that it would
be give and take to the bitter end with no weakening
of spirit and no quarter given.</p>

<p>Both boys were athletes in the best of condition,
though Jeff Thatcher, slightly younger than
his antagonist, had taken better care of himself.
Both knew more than the rudiments of boxing, as
was evident from the start. Alert, eager, yet cautiously
watchful, they stepped stealthily around
each other there in the darkness. Gould was the
first to lead, stepping in and flashing a vicious
straight left to Thatcher’s face. But Jeff countered
with such amazing speed that Gould’s blow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
was made harmless by a jolting left that he received
full in the face.</p>

<p>It stung him like a whiplash, for with a grunt,
half of pain and half of anger, he stepped in
again with both hands driving piston-like into
Thatcher’s face. The attack was so vicious and
so strong that Jeff could only stagger back, block
and stall as best he could, watching for an opening
to cut in with a smashing blow that would
break up the attack. He found it. Gould, in his
haste and rage, stumbled slightly and with his
loss of balance dropped his hands ever so little.
Jeff, alert and waiting for this, started an upper-cut
from the hip that had all the strength of his
powerful back and arm in it. Like a striking
snake it darted in between Gould’s hands and
landed with a sickening smack on the point of
Gould’s chin. His head snapped back and his
body sagged forward for the slightest fraction
of a second, and Birdie Pell, with a cry of alarm,
stepped toward him, for the younger boy thought
that Gould had been knocked out.</p>

<p>The Sophomore went down to one knee, stayed
there for a moment and brushed his arm across
his eyes as if to clear his whirling head. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
suddenly with a roar of anger <a href="#i_fp016">he</a> leaped to his
feet and <a href="#i_fp016">rushed into another furious attack</a>. But
he was in a towering rage now and his efforts
were far from the well-timed blows he had used
before. Thatcher saw this with a degree of satisfaction
and it was with less difficulty that he side-stepped
and blocked each blow and shot home
crashing lefts and rights, each time an opening
presented itself. He was hammering Gould badly
now and the Sophomore’s anger was mounting
higher and higher and his blows were becoming
wilder and wilder with each passing second.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_16">He rushed into another furious attack</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then suddenly a strange and astonishing thing
happened. The darkness in which they had been
fighting was suddenly shattered and illuminated
by a flood of white light from two glaring searchlights,
as a car, approaching unheard by the three
boys, swung swiftly around the corner of the
gymnasium building, and with squeaking brakes
came suddenly to a stop.</p>

<p>The two antagonists and Birdie Pell stood
silhouetted against the white glare, staring
stupidly at each other and into the blinding
lights. Then Gould, coming to his senses, suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>exclaimed: “Dr. Livingston—beat it,” and
rushing for his coat, which Birdie Pell held in his
arms, he and the smaller boy ran out of the shafts
of light and into the blackness of the night.</p>

<p>As for Jeff Thatcher, he realized with a sickening
sensation that it was Dr. Livingston’s car.
He realized too that the Headmaster had caught
them in the act of fighting, a thing that was forbidden
on the school grounds—an offense that
merited serious punishment.</p>

<p>With sinking heart he saw the big, overcoated
figure of Dr. Livingston step out of the car and
come toward him.</p>

<p>“Well, Thatcher, what does this mean?”</p>

<p>Jeff could not think of an appropriate answer
but evidently Dr. Livingston did not expect any.</p>

<p>“Fighting, eh? This is serious. I’m sorry,
Thatcher. Were the others Gould and Pell?”</p>

<p>Jeff’s lips closed in a straight line. It was a
question he could not in honor answer.</p>

<p>“Never mind. I saw them and recognized them
both. Go to your room, Thatcher, and report to
me at ten o’clock to-morrow morning. This, as
you know, warrants serious discipline.”</p>

<p>And Jeff, with the unpleasant feeling of a culprit
caught in the act, turned toward Carter Hall.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>FORCED OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“This warrants serious discipline.”</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston’s words, with their uncomfortable
portent kept racing through Jeff Thatcher’s
mind as he sat in his room in Carter Hall. He
knew all that this would mean to him. Not that,
ordinarily, he was afraid to face whatever punishment
was due him, but in this case he realized
it would be far more serious to him than it would
to almost any other boy in school. And the unpleasant
part of it was that although Gould would
receive the same disciplining, he would not suffer
half as much as Thatcher would. Disciplining to
the Sophomore, and to Pell for that matter, for
he would unquestionably be implicated, would
mean nothing more than so much punishment to
be endured until they had paid the penalty, then
they would be free to go on in their usual happy
routine at school.</p>

<p>But for Thatcher it meant a great deal more.
It meant disaster. It meant the sacrificing of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
opportunity to play baseball on the best school
team in the state; it meant that he would have
to forego the happiness of school life, and most
of all, it meant sacrificing his opportunities for
an education. Thatcher realized that all this was
in the balance and there is little wonder that he
regretted his rash actions in getting into a fight
with Gould on the school ground. It would have
been far better if he had passed on, or if it had
to be a fight, he should have refused to fight except
out of bounds where school laws did not
reach; across the bridge over Wading River, or
on the other side of the town.</p>

<p>“What a fool I was,” he muttered as he sat on
the edge of his bed, his elbows on his knees and
his face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the hall outside his door,
and presently it was pushed open, then shut with
a bang.</p>

<p>Thatcher raised his head just long enough to
see that it was Wade Grenville, his roommate,
who had entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Wade,” he mumbled, scarcely rousing
himself from his disconsolate attitude.</p>

<p>“’Lo, Jeff. For the love of Pete, what’s the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
matter with you? Still feeling sore over Gould’s
dirty trick? Cut it, Jeff, cut it. Don’t take it so
blamed hard. The rest of the fellows have forgotten
it already; passed it up as a mucker’s trick
and figure to get square on Gould and the Sophs
some other time. That’s the way you want to
take it. Buck up,” and he flung his cap on his
own bed across the room and went over and
clapped his hands affectionately on Jeff’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>Jeff looked up and smiled ruefully.</p>

<p>“I’m square, I guess, or nearly so, but—”</p>

<p>“What? Say, Jeff, what’s that cut on your
cheek? and—and—say, by jingoes, you’ve been
fighting. Jiminy, was it with Gould? Did you
lick him? Good stuff, old Kid, only why didn’t
you tip a fellow off. I’d like to have seen you
clout him one just for luck and the rest of the
fellows would have enjoyed it too. Where did
you pull it off?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—it wasn’t prearranged. It just
happened. We ran into each other out back of
the gym. and had it out and—and—well, we got
caught.”</p>

<p>“Great cats, you don’t say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. It’s true. Wish it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy. Who caught you?” Wade looked at
Jeff admiringly as he asked the question.</p>

<p>“The old man himself, of course. Who should
it be but Dr. Livingston,” Jeff replied bitterly.</p>

<p>“Jingoes, that’s rough, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Worse than that.”</p>

<p>“Aw, never mind. You’ll be out of trouble by
baseball time, though. Buck up.”</p>

<p>“Out of trouble by baseball time? Yes, I guess
I will. And out of Pennington, too.”</p>

<p>“Aw, he won’t fire you out. He’s not a stickler
like that. He’d only take away your special privileges
and—Jiminy, you’ll lose your table job,
won’t you?” Wade began to look concerned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and my newspaper and magazine privilege,
and my laundry business and that will be the
finish.”</p>

<p>“Finish?”</p>

<p>“Yes, finish.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Hang it, man, don’t you see, if I lose all my
special privileges I won’t be able to stay in school.
Those jobs pay my way here. I haven’t a cent
otherwise and if they are taken away from me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
I’ll have to quit school and go to work. I haven’t
a cent coming in from home—haven’t any home,
really. I lived with my uncle, you know, and he
can’t contribute anything. I’ve been hustling for
my own living ever since Dad died, and that’s
three years ago. So you see, if I lose my jobs
here, I’m a goner. I’ll have to leave school and
go to work to support myself.”</p>

<p>“Jingoes, that’s tough, Jeff. But maybe Dr.
Livingston will take all those things into consideration
and—and—”</p>

<p>“’Fraid not, Wade. You know what a stickler
he is for rules and obedience. Fighting on the
school grounds is a serious offense, as he said,
and the penalty is only one thing,—all special
privileges are withdrawn and the unfortunate
chap has to spend two weeks in bounds. Of course
it doesn’t make a bit of difference with Gould or
Pell, they both have rich fathers to foot their bills—Gould
has, at least—and they have been too lazy
to work up jobs the way I’ve had to. The only
special privileges that will be taken away from
them will be the privilege of leaving the school
grounds, going to the basketball games and attending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
whatever ‘spreads’ and ‘hops’ that might
take place in the next couple of weeks. The worst
privation they’ll suffer is that of going without
their cigarettes; they won’t be able to go across
the bridge to steal a smoke. At that they’ll probably
take a chance and sneak their smokes in their
rooms. Wish that was all I’d have to suffer, believe
me, smokes don’t mean a single thing to me,
but leaving Pennington means the whole world,
right now. Gee, it’s going to be tough.” And
Jeff slumped back into the attitude of dejection
that Wade had seen him in when he entered the
room.</p>

<p>Wade sat down on his bed, too, and was glumly
silent for a long time. He knew that Jeff had
spoken the truth. There was small hope that Dr.
Livingston would waive rules even in the case of
Jeff Thatcher, and Wade thought of all that Jeff’s
going would mean to him. They had been roommates
and pals for months now; since the beginning
of the school term in September. It was
going to be a hard ordeal to part with Jeff,—life
at Pennington was not going to be the same for
him; at least that was how he felt at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“Jiminy, it’s going to be rough on the both of
us, Jeff,” he said finally, “but it’s going to be
especially tough for you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jeff with a forced smile, “the
worst is yet to come. Come on to bed. I don’t
much feel like trying to digest Cæsar and his
Gaelic Wars to-night, and anyhow I guess it won’t
make much difference whether I’m prepared in
Latin to-morrow or not. Come on, turn in.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>ON HIS OWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Both Jeff and Wade spent a restless night. Jeff
lay awake until long after the clock in the Congregational
church tower across the river in New
City boomed the hour of midnight, so overwrought
were his nerves over the day’s occurrences and
the interview with Dr. Livingston and what it
would bring forth on the morrow. And as he lay
there tossing between the blankets he realized
more and more how hopeless his case was and
how cheerless the outlook for his own future was.</p>

<p>What was he to do? Where was he to turn?
He could not go back to live with his uncle without
finding employment for himself, and where
would he turn to find this? Where—</p>

<p>A thought occurred to him that kept him awake
for nearly an hour longer. One of the privileges
that would be taken away from him as a result
of his disobedience to the school rules was the
privilege of acting as school correspondent for
the New City <cite>Daily Freeman</cite>. He had secured the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
position by bearding “Boss” Russell, the city
editor of the <cite>Freeman</cite>, in his office and making
application for the job almost before his predecessor,
Harold Hall, was graduated from Pennington.
And ever since he had been contributing
paragraphs of school news to the paper,
stories of the football and basketball games, and
various other “write ups” for which he had been
paid space rates, and had in that way earned a
neat sum each week which managed to keep him
in clothes and buy some of his books. His work
had been acceptable to the paper, he knew, and
he wondered, now that he was going to be thrown
out on his own, why it wouldn’t be possible for
him to join the staff of the <cite>Freeman</cite> as a cub reporter.
It was a great idea. He would try.</p>

<p>And then, thinking of the romance of being a
reporter, some time between midnight and daylight
he fell asleep and dreamed that he had suddenly
become a newspaper man, indeed the only
employee his particular dream newspaper had.
He was reporter, city editor, typesetter, printer
and pressman all in one, and he had a wild nightmare
of a career that ended when he got into an
altercation with a big printing press and the iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
monster stood up on its hind legs and began clawing
the air, finally grabbing him in its teeth and,
like some prehistoric monster, it shook him back
and forth until he woke up with a yell to find
Wade Grenville standing over his bed and pulling
him out from between the blankets by the slack
of his pajamas.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, turn out. It’s seven-thirty.
You haven’t a dickens of a lot of time to
get cleaned and report for chapel. Come on, Jeff,
shake a leg. You’ve got a tough day ahead of
you, you poor kid.”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t remind me of it, Wade. I hate to
face the Old Man and hear sentence pronounced.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got to face the music. I hope
he gives it to Gould and Pell as stiff as he can.
Blast ’em! If it hadn’t been for that dirty trick
Gould pulled you wouldn’t be in this peck of
trouble. Go ahead. Wash up.”</p>

<p>Jeff made little ceremony of his morning toilet.
He turned on the water in the wash basin until it
gushed out with such a splash that it spattered
the walls and slopped over onto the floor. Then,
in his undershirt and trousers, he plunged his
head and arms into the basin and wallowed around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
like a seal, puffing and snorting and blowing and
adding a great deal more to the water that was
already on the floor, until presently there seemed
to be more there than there was in the bowl.
Then he came up for air, and with eyes squeezed
tight shut and his face distorted, he began feeling
around for a towel, which Wade obligingly
wadded up into a ball and threw at him, shouting
at the same time:</p>

<p>“There, you blamed hippopotamus; there’s
your towel. Why in the dickens do you have to
have the floor knee deep in water before you feel
you are properly washed. Now I’ve got to put
on my rubber boots or my bathing suit before I
can cross the room to get my necktie. Every
time you take a wash this room looks like that
painting of Washington crossing the Delaware,
only more so.”</p>

<p>“Aw, let me alone. You’ll be sorry when I’m
not around to muss up your old floor. You wait
and see.”</p>

<p>“Jingoes, you’re right I will, Jeff. I— Great
guns, there goes the first bell. Grab your things
and get ’em on. Come on quick.”</p>

<p>A mad scramble followed and both fellows only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
just squeezed into the last of their clothing as the
final bell rang and they dashed for the hall and
the chapel door.</p>

<p>But Jeff’s thoughts were far from being on the
services and the announcements. Indeed, when
he was thrown back among the boys again he realized
once more with an aching heart how hard it
was going to be to leave all this behind, and the
prospects of a position on the <cite>Freeman</cite> did not
seem half as alluring as it had the night before.</p>

<p>Somehow news of the fight had got through the
school and Jeff found himself the object of admiring
glances from the Freshmen and glowering
looks from the Sophomores, and when the boys
filed out from chapel Buck Hart, Rabbit Warren,
Cas Gorham and Brownie Davis, got him aside
and congratulated him.</p>

<p>“Great stuff, old fellow. Wish you’d have
given him a black eye for me. That’s a fine lump
he has on his cheek and his nose will never be the
same,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“He sure looked cut up this morning. I had a
good look at him,” said Rabbit Warren, slapping
Jeff on the shoulder.</p>

<p>To all this Jeff smiled ruefully. It was on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
tongue to tell them too that in reality he had got
the worst of it, but he glanced up in time to see
Dr. Livingston coming down the hall. The principal
caught his eye and motioned to him to follow,
and Jeff broke away from his admirers and hurried
to the Doctor’s office.</p>

<p>Gould and Pell were already there, and Jeff
was surprised to see how many scars of battle the
former bore. His nose was in an unpleasant state
of redness and abnormally swollen and there was
just the suggestion of blackness about his right
eye. There was a slight cut on his right cheek,
too.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston sat down in his chair and swung
around to look at all three. They were silent for
several minutes while he looked at them frowningly.
Finally he spoke in a sharp, crisp voice.</p>

<p>“You three boys know the rules of the school
as well as I do. I am very much put out with you.
Gould, you and Pell stay in bounds for a month.
No privileges whatever, and report to Professor
Battel for an extra hour’s Latin every day during
the period. And mind you, if there is one complaint
against you from any quarter out you go,
dismissed from the school. I’ll not have boys of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
your stamp around here. You are both on probation,
so mind your conduct. Go to your class.
Thatcher, I want to see you alone a moment.”</p>

<p>Jeff’s heart seemed to drop into his shoes as
Gould and Pell departed. “Why does he want to
see me alone?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston looked at him in silence for some
time after the two boys had gone. Finally he
spoke, and to Jeff it seemed as if his tone was a
little more fatherly than it had been to Gould or
Pell.</p>

<p>“Thatcher,” he said, “this is the most unpleasant
task I have had in all my career with boys.
I have laid awake most of the night thinking of
just what this was going to mean to you but I can
see no way out. Rules are rules, and you know
it as well as I do. That holds not only in school
but in life generally, and the quicker you find it
out the better off you’ll be. Rules are rules, laws
are laws, and when you break either of them you
must be punished. I have come to the conclusion
that I cannot make an exception even of you, and
I realize in making this decision just how disastrous
it is going to be for you. My only hope is
that somehow you will find a way out of the difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
I will have to suspend all your privileges
for the rest of the term, and you will have to
remain in bounds for two weeks at least. That
is the minimum penalty, as you know. I’m very,
very sorry.”</p>

<p>In spite of his best efforts at self-control tears
welled up in Jeff Thatcher’s eyes and a great
lump gathered in his throat as Dr. Livingston
talked. It was several seconds before he could
speak without breaking down completely.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” he finally gulped, “but I guess
it means the end of my career at Pennington. I
can’t stay if my privileges are taken away. I—I—”
Jeff gulped and turned away, starting tear-blind
for the door.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry too, son. I only hope you’ll find a
way out of the difficulty. I’d help you if I could
but there is no way I can grant you special privileges
under the circumstances. Go to your class
now and see if there isn’t some way you can work
the situation out.”</p>

<p>But to Jeff there was no way out. He puzzled
over it all day in his classes and all evening in
the privacy of his room, for Wade had gone to a
concert in town with several other fellows and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Jeff was left alone with his unpleasant problem.
He pondered over every phase of it until he became
so discouraged and unhappy that he realized
in desperation that he would have to quit Pennington
forthwith, leave while yet he had a few
dollars in his pockets with which to take care of
himself while trying to find a position.</p>

<p>He listened. The big clock over in New City
was booming the hour. He counted the strokes.
It was nine o’clock. Why not leave now? Leave
while Wade and the rest of the fellows were away.
He knew that he did not have the courage to stay
and bid them all good-by. He realized he would
break down and probably make a chump of himself.
Now was the time to go. And besides, he
realized, now was the time when he could best get
at Boss Russell, the city editor of the <cite>Daily Freeman</cite>,
and perhaps secure the position he so much
needed. He would go.</p>

<p>Hastily, almost eagerly, he packed up his few
belongings and put them in his suitcase. Several
little personal things he purposely overlooked, for
he wanted to leave them for Wade to remember
him by. In twenty minutes he had completed his
task. Then he sat down at his desk in the corner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and hastily scribbled Wade a note telling him of
his plans. He read this over once, tucked it into
an envelope, and dropped it on Wade’s bed. Then
he picked up his suitcase, snapped out the light
and stepped out into the broad hall and tiptoed
his way to the big side door of the building, fearful
lest he should disturb Dr. Hornby, the professor
in charge of the house.</p>

<p>Out on the campus, he paused a moment in the
shadow of the building and looked about. It was
a hard pull to leave. It made his throat and eyes
fill up once more, and it was only with the utmost
self-control that he kept from breaking down as
he finally stepped out among the tall elms on the
campus and hurried toward the big gate and the
street where a trolley to New City stood waiting
at the end of the line.</p>

<small>THE CUB REPORTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Fortune and Boss Russell favored Jeff Thatcher.
When he appeared at half past ten that night in
the <cite>Freeman</cite> office the city editor was in a
quandary over the illness of two members of his
staff and the resignation of a third, and when he
peered over his glasses at Jeff Thatcher as he
stood in front of his desk, he realized that here
was part of the solution to the unpleasant situation
of finding himself short-handed.</p>

<p>“You are young,” he told Jeff, “but your school
stuff has been mighty good for a beginner, and I’ll
take you on as a cub, if you want to take Mulvaney’s
place. I’ve moved Mull up as special
assignment man and you can run his obits and
cover the hospitals for accident cases.” And so
Jeff became a member of the <cite>Freeman</cite> staff with
surprising quickness. Indeed, he started out
forthwith to make what was to be his nightly
rounds of undertaking establishments and hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
even at that late hour, and at first he took
a keen delight in the work.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as an assignment book
in the office of the New City <cite>Daily Freeman</cite>.
That method was far too slow for city editor,
Boss Russell. He preferred to give out assignments
over the city desk just as fast as they
developed. He would hand them over with a few
penciled notes, or a newspaper clipping or so, and
some terse, snappy instructions that usually were
enough to inspire any one of his staff of reporters
to write the best story of his career. If he did not
he stood a good chance of being fired. Boss Russell
wanted the best that was in a man all the
time. And he usually got it.</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher watched this nightly distribution
of assignments for two weeks. He watched it at
first eagerly, hopefully speculating on what his
would be. But as nights went on he watched it
none the less eagerly, but far from hopeful. He
soon grew to know what his assignments would
be. Boss Russell had a method all his own of
breaking in cub reporters. Jeff began to realize
that it was a method that treated said cub as if
he were a machine. He had already begun to feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
like the cogs in a watch or the gears in an automobile.
Life became a constant succession of
visits to certain undertaking establishments for
obituaries of the people who had died that day, a
nightly trip to police headquarters to copy the unimportant
police slips of accidents, a visit to the
Memorial Hospital, after which he would return
to the <cite>Freeman</cite> office, there to sit down in front
of a typewriter and laboriously grind out paragraph
after paragraph of names, dates and ages
of people who had been injured and who had died
during the past twenty-four hours. Jeff began to
feel like a dead one himself.</p>

<p>Night after night he watched the line of reporters
file by Boss Russell’s desk to get their
assignment and fare forth on some interesting
news quest, but always when he, usually last, arrived
at the desk, the city editor would wearily
pass over to him a cryptic note “undertakers,
headquarters, Memorial Hospital, Jones wedding,”
or perhaps the last would be varied with
such notations as “see Dr. Bisbee on Brinkerhoff
accident,” or “Look in at Æolian Hall, Plumber’s
Association dance.” It was always the same.
Jeff had come to the conclusion that he never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
would get a real news story to write. He wondered
why cleaning streets or delivering milk
would not be just as interesting and perhaps a lot
more remunerative.</p>

<p>The night of March 15 was no different than all
the rest. As on a succession of nights previous,
he got the same terse notation. With very little
enthusiasm he ran his eyes over the slip of paper.
“Undertakers, Memorial Hospital and drop in at
Erie Railroad Yards and find Tim Crowley. He
had a three-legged calf born on his farm yesterday.”
Jeff looked at the last notation twice and
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Three-legged calf. Huh, it’s a little different
than a hod carrier’s dance, but I won’t set the
town on fire with the story I might write about
that,” and, with a grunt of dissatisfaction, Jeff
buttoned up his overcoat and turned up his collar
and fared forth into a near zero night, and started
on his monotonous rounds of undertaking establishments,
meanwhile wondering vaguely what the
fellows were doing over in Pennington, and wishing
mightily that he might be sent out on a story
across the river to Montvale, where the old school
was located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Goodness knows the town was full of good news
stories; why couldn’t Boss Russell trust him with
one of them. There was the prolonged street car
strike in Montvale. Why couldn’t he get an assignment
to go over there and write a story of one
of their frequent riots. Then he would have a
chance to look in at Pennington, anyhow, and tell
some of the fellows what he was doing. Why
couldn’t he get sent out on a good fire story such
as the warehouse fire on the east side two nights
ago. That would have been a story worth writing.
Spectacular stuff about bursting gasoline barrels,
heroic firemen and all that. There was a murder
mystery in town, too. That Italian banker who
had been found dead in his own doorway with the
Mafia death sign on his forehead. Why didn’t
Boss Russell turn him loose on that story, and see
if he had ingenuity enough to find Joe Gattiano,
the suspected murderer who had mysteriously disappeared
from town. Other reporters had tried
and failed and the story was old now. Why not
let him try his hand? Goodness knows he couldn’t
spoil the story or fare any worse than the other
<cite>Freeman</cite> reporters had. Even the moth-eaten
and written out Third National Bank theft would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
be a relief. Perhaps he could find some clew of
the absconding paying teller, Roderick Hammond,
who nearly a month ago had disappeared from
the bank at the same time that a hundred thousand
dollars worth of Liberty Bonds were discovered
to be missing. Nothing had been heard of Hammond
or the bonds since, and now after columns
of speculative stories had been printed the case
was dropped and forgotten. Jeff wished that
Boss Russell would give him a chance to revive
even that case again. But no, it was “undertakers,
Memorial Hospital and—and—plumbers’
dances, or three-legged calves or—or—beans.”
Jeff snorted the last in disgust as he turned into
the first mortuary chapel on his list.</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher was a cub reporter. But he was
not the cubbiest cub reporter that had ever tried
to break in on the <cite>Freeman</cite>. He was a born
newspaper man. He loved the work. Ever since
he had shed knee trousers he had been enthusiastic
about journalism, and about the next best thing
to finishing out his course at Pennington, in Jeff’s
estimation, was serving as a reporter under
Boss Russell. The <cite>Freeman</cite> was a morning
paper. It came onto the news stands and street<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
corners in the dark hours before dawn so that
newsboys could deliver it in time to have it read
over breakfast tables or in the street cars while
New City’s business men were on their way to
office, store or shop. And to get a newspaper out
at that time of day meant that reporters, typesetters
and pressmen must work all night. Jeff came
into the editorial rooms at six o’clock at night
just when other young business men were going
home to their evening meal and rest. And Jeff,
with others of the staff, worked on through the
night until two or three o’clock in the morning
gathering news of the day’s happenings and writing
stories that were read by Boss Russell and his
trained copy readers and sent upstairs to the composing
room to be set in type to be printed in the
morning editions.</p>

<p>It was a hard life, for Jeff had to reverse his
whole method of living, working nights and tumbling
into bed at four or five o’clock in the morning
to sleep until noontime or later. But if it was
hard it was also fascinating and Jeff realized that
it could be made more fascinating if he could only
get a chance to work on some of the really big news
stories of the day instead of plugging along writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
obituaries and paragraphs of but little consequence.</p>

<p>Grumbling inwardly and feeling more or less
discouraged, Jeff left the Memorial Hospital,
where he had looked over the book of the day’s
arrival and departure of patients, and talked with
the intern. He turned in the direction of the big
Erie Railroad yards located west of the city,
where he hoped to find Tim Crowley, and learn
the details of this bovine prodigy that had been
born out on Tim’s little farm a mile or so from
New City.</p>

<p>The railroad’s yards covered several acres of
ground and included a big station, a dispatcher’s
office, roundhouse, freight yard, and machine
shop, and myriads of switch towers, semaphores
and block signals, the red and green lights of
which blinked and winked at him in the cold winter
night as Jeff picked his way across the network
of tracks to the building in which the dispatcher’s
office was located. It was mighty cold
and growing colder. Wind whipped the steam
and smoke from the roundhouse gustily across the
yard, icicles of huge proportions hung from the
dripping spouts of the crane-like nozzles of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
water tanks, and the few switch engines that sputtered
about the yards, shunting cars here and
there,—coughed hoarsely as if the cold had somehow
gotten into their iron chests and made them a
bit asthmatic.</p>

<p>Jeff pushed open the door of the dispatcher’s
office, to be greeted with a rattling fusillade from
a score of clicking telegraph instruments that
were spattering the air full of, to Jeff, unintelligible
dots and dashes. It was warm and cheerful
in there and he made for a bulky steam radiator
that was hissing comfortably, as he pulled off his
gloves and breathed on the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>Tom Kelly, the big, good-natured chief dispatcher,
in shirt sleeves and vest, got up from his
desk and came over to greet him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jeff. Ain’t seen you in a week. What
gust of wind blew you over in this direction?”
said Kelly.</p>

<p>“Came over to see Tim Crowley. Where is he
and what is there to the story about his—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that three-legged calf. Funny blamed
thing, isn’t it? But it’s facts. Some of the fellows
saw it. Tim’s the wrecking boss. You’ll find
him on the wrecking train over on track sixteen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
It’s warm and cheerful over there and the whole
wrecking crew are probably playing cards in the
‘hack.’ If you get over you might be just in time
to have a midnight snack with them. They eat
about this time,” said Kelly, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“Thanks. So long. See you again some time,”
said Jeff, buttoning up his coat once more and
going out into the night.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>WITH THE WRECKERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jeff knew where track sixteen was and it did not
take him long to find the wrecking train. There
it was on a siding with a clear way to the main
track. It was a train of caboose and six flat cars,
two of which were equipped with tremendously
powerful, but squatty and flat-looking derricks.
The others were loaded with boxes of tools, and
all sorts of emergency equipment. The train reminded
Jeff of an engine or hook and ladder truck
of the city fire department ready to get away at
a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>A warm glow of light came from the cupola and
the more or less smudged windows of the “hack,”
as Kelly had called the caboose, and Jeff knew
that the wrecking crew, who lived in the train,
in shifts day and night, week in and week out the
whole year through, were inside card playing or
reading or amusing themselves as husky railroad
men do while awaiting word of trouble or a wreck
that calls them out to clear the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>Jeff stamped his way up the steps of the hack,
shoved open the door and stepped inside. Gathered
around a table in the yellow glare of a big electric
light, that hurt Jeff’s eyes momentarily, were the
wreckers, big broad-chested, broad-shouldered, experienced
railroad men who seemed to Jeff the
impersonation of courage, resourcefulness and reliability.
They were the men who were responsible
for keeping the line open so that trains could
run uninterruptedly no matter how grave the
catastrophe or how serious the damages. And
they were good-natured and hearty men, as was
evident from the greeting that the boss of them
all, big Tim Crowley, gave him, when he introduced
himself and began to ask questions about
the three-legged calf.</p>

<p>But Jeff had scarcely got well started on his
catechizing when the door of the caboose was flung
open and banged closed again and a man from the
dispatcher’s office, still in his shirt sleeves despite
the cold and with his green eye shade on his forehead,
burst in upon them. In his hand he held a
piece of flimsy yellow paper, a dispatcher’s telegraph
blank, on which was typed a brief but evidently
important message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Tim, No. 89, fast freight out of New City is
piled up at Granville cross-over. Ten cars off the
track and some of them smashed to pieces. Both
tracks are blocked. Tracy, the conductor, says
it’s a bad mess. Engine 1107 with Ed Dixon is
backing down to pick you up. Cold night for a
wreck, ain’t it? Wish you luck,” and passing the
yellow slip to Tim he slammed his way out and
raced back to the dispatcher’s office.</p>

<p>For a moment Jeff did not realize what was
happening. But as he heard the hoarse blasts of
an engine not far off and felt the jarring clank as
it backed against the wrecking train and coupled
up he understood it all.</p>

<p>“You best beat it if you don’t want to take a
lively ride,” said Tim with a smile, as the men
put their cards away and got up from the table.</p>

<p>“Beat it! What? With a wreck on the line and
me on board the wrecking train ready to roll.
Not on your life; that is, of course, if you will let
me go along,” said Jeff, looking eagerly at Tim.</p>

<p>“As a reporter there ain’t no rules against it,
I guess,” said Tim, sliding into his heavy coat.
“Go along if you want to. Tumble out, men.”</p>

<p>It took a remarkably short time for the crew,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
swarming over the train of flat cars, to get everything
ready for the run, and by the time the engine
was coupled on everything was “ship shape,” to
quote the wrecking boss, and the men were back
in the hack.</p>

<p>With several deep-toned, almost arrogant blasts
big, panting 1107 got under way and began clanking
over frogs and switches, making toward the
tracks of the main line. Jeff crawled up into the
cupola of the hack where Tim and three other
husky wreckers sat, looking out above the flat cars
toward the engine ahead.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a ride this night,” said Tim to
Jeff, smiling as he spoke. “Ol’ eleven-o-seven is
a speed boy, an’ with Ed Dixon in the cab we’ll
be yanked along somethin’ fierce. Sixty mile an
hour won’t be a patch to what we’ll make. The
dispatchers have cleared the track from here to
the wreck. They always do for the wrecking train.
Ain’t only one train that can have the right o’
way over us and that would be a hospital train
with nurses and doctors aboard which they’d send
out if this was a passenger wreck. But t’ track’s
clear to-night with everything in sidings, so ol’
Ed Dixon will burn up the rails.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>THE WRECK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jeff noticed that “Ol’ Ed” was proceeding to
fulfill Tim’s predictions with a will. The wrecking
train was gathering speed with every passing
second. The clank of rail joints as the wheels
passed over them developed from a measured beat
to a steady hum. Jeff had never moved so fast in
all his life. Up and down grades they roared,
around curves they snapped with a vengeance
that threatened to send the caboose off the tracks
and whizzing through the air like the snapper of
a whip. “Ol’ Eleven-o-seven’s” whistle seemed
never to stop shrieking for grade crossings, and
Jeff wondered what would happen to a luckless
automobile or team of horses that might get
caught on one of the crossings as the wrecking
train plunged down upon them.</p>

<p>Mile after mile was clicked off with measured
regularity and in twenty-two minutes by Jeff’s
watch the thirty-five miles to the wreck were covered
and the monster engine began to slow down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
as grinding, spark-flinging brake shoes were applied.</p>

<p>Jeff and big Tim and the rest knew that they
were approaching the wreck long before the train
began to come to its crunching stop, for far ahead
on the tracks, far beyond the stabbing white ray
of the engine’s searching headlight, they could
make out a pink glow in the sky and a blotch of
lurid red behind some trees.</p>

<p>“There it is and it’s caught fire, too,” said
Tim, letting himself down from the cupola and
slipping off his heavy coat again. “Come on,
men. Tumble out. We got a job to do. The line
must be open before the commutation trains start
to come down to-morrow morning. Lively now.
Snap to it.”</p>

<p>And snap to it they did. Jeff marveled at the
enthusiasm with which they prepared to go out
into the near zero weather and do battle with a
stubborn wreck that was on fire in the bargain.</p>

<p>By the time the train had come to a halt and
the wreckers had tumbled out, Jeff could see by
the rays of the searching headlight, in all its stark
unpleasantness, a huge mass of twisted iron and
steel, up-ended cars, overturned trucks and splintered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
ties and débris through which licked red-tongued
flames. Here was the wreck that was
blocking the line, the wreck that these men must
clear away before daylight. It was a sight almost
horrible to behold. Part way down the embankment
and turned on its side was the locomotive,
steam and smoke still curling about it. It looked
like some prehistoric giant wounded and dying.
A smoke pall hung over the entire scene, into
which the wreckers, armed with axes and crowbars
plunged, looking more like gnomes than human
beings in that weird setting.</p>

<p>Keyed up with the excitement of it all, Jeff, also
armed with an ax that he had hastily seized from
an open tool box on one of the flat cars, followed
them, and soon he found himself in the thick of
things. Piled up across the right of way and
down the embankment on either side were what
an hour ago had been ten big red and yellow
freight cars. Now they were junk; just a mass of
terribly twisted, splintered and crushed wood and
iron, all mixed up with railroad ties and
corkscrew-looking rails that had been torn from
the roadbed by the force of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Tim, the boss wrecker, stopped a moment and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
looked the mess over. In particular he looked at
the fire that was raging at the other end of the
wreck.</p>

<p>“Looks like that fire was going to help us some
in getting this thing clear. But we can’t wait for
that. Hello, Tracy,” the last was said to a railroad
man who came out of the smoke, followed by
two others. He was the conductor of the luckless
freight.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tim. Rotten mess, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“You said it. Any one hurt? How’s the engineer
and fireman?”</p>

<p>“Both back in our hack. Pretty well shaken
up but outside of a slight burn that Norton got
they are both all right. They’ll be out to lend a
hand as soon as they get some of the cinders
picked out o’ their hides.”</p>

<p>“Fine. All right, men. We clear the eastbound
track first. You, Casey, take your men
and get that No. 1 derrick up here. You, Saunders,
start to cut away and move that stuff so we
can get the derrick up to the first car. Come on,
men, snap to it. Casey, tell that biscuit-shooter
of ours to get that hot coffee and sandwiches on
the job in a hurry. We want a snack before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
cold gets into us. Shake a leg. Shake both of
’em.”</p>

<p>The wreckers went into action. The engine’s
big headlight illuminated the scene and made the
night as light as day. Men with crowbars and
axes fell to clearing the wreckage that might obstruct
the movement of the derrick. Another
crew attended to the laying of temporary tracks
by means of which the engine could be shunted
from the front to the rear of the wrecking train
so that the first of the big derricks could be moved
slowly up into place close to the wreck.</p>

<p>All this was accomplished in a remarkably short
time considering the work involved, and while
Jeff worked and sweated with the rest of the men
and gulped down innumerable cups of steaming
coffee and ate all the sandwiches he could consume
as they were brought up by the grinning
negro cook of the wrecking train, the first big
derrick was moved up into place and like a giant
elephant began to slowly nose its way into the
wreck.</p>

<p>Then didn’t the men work! With this giant
helper the task of clearing one track seemed to
simplify. The men burrowed into the wreckage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
like so many field mice, carrying the chains of
the derrick with them. These they snapped
around heavy trucks, backed away and gave the
signal, and the derrick would slowly lift the obstruction
out of the way and swing it around onto
one of the flat cars or off onto the embankment
where it was deposited for the time being. Whole
sections of freight cars were lifted by this mastodontic
machine, as slowly it crept further and
further into the heart of the wreckage foot by
foot, clearing one track so that the line would be
partially opened as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Jeff left off toiling when this big thing came
into action, for it was the first time that he had
ever seen one of the machines at work and he
could not do other than stand and marvel at its
power. But the wreckers kept right on working.
They had all stripped themselves of their heavy
coats and now worked in sweaters, and many of
them even in shirt sleeves, despite the zero
weather. And Jeff could see that most of them
were sweating with the terrific exertion that the
work called for. Indeed he could hardly believe
that human beings could keep right on laboring
the way they did and not drop from exhaustion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Already he was so tired that he could scarcely
swing the ax he had been wielding and yet he
realized that he had not done one-tenth part of
the work any one of the wreckers had. The realization
made him feel almost ashamed of himself,
and gritting his teeth, he spat on his hands and
prepared once more to wade into the wreckage
with the rest of them.</p>

<p>But before he bent to his task, Big Tim Crowley,
who had been climbing over the wreckage,
jumped down from the slanting roof of a partly
crushed car almost alongside of him. Jeff noticed
that there was a strange look on the face of
the big boss, as he spoke to Tracy, the conductor,
who was prying at a stubborn mass with a crowbar.</p>

<p>“Tracy, you sure none o’ your crew was caught
in this?”</p>

<p>“Yep, they’re all accounted for. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s some poor devil pinned down in
under that mass toward the other end and the fire’s
movin’ up on him fast. I heard him groaning
and I located him. He’s pinned down under an
up-ended truck with almost a whole freight car
piled on top of him. And t’ fire’s creepin’ in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
there, too. T’ worst of it is he’s too far into the
wreck for us to reach him with t’ derrick, before
t’ fire gets to him, and if we go digging for him
we’ll bring a whole pile of wreckage down on top
of him.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, you don’t say so,” said Tracy,
standing up and looking troubled. “I know he
ain’t one of my train crew but he might be a hobo.
Kahalan said he thought there was a ’bo tryin’
t’ hop aboard when we left t’ yard at New City,
but he said it was too danged cold to go out and
drive him off t’ bumpers if he did get aboard.
Poor devil. I’ll bet that’s who it is an’ he got
nipped.”</p>

<p>Others, including Jeff, had stopped working
now and were listening. Jeff looked off toward
the other end of the wreck where the fire, undiminished
in its fury, was eating into the mass
of splintered woodwork that had been perfectly
good freight cars a few hours since, and shuddered
as he realized the horrible position the man
was in; as he realized the horrible death that he
was facing, pinned in there waiting for the flames
to reach him.</p>

<p>“Well, hobo or not, we got to get him out if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
we can,” snapped Tim. “But t’ worst of it is
he’s in about the nastiest place in t’ whole wreck.
We can’t cut our way down to him because there’s
a truck and twisted brake beams and like of that
in the way, an’ if we go pryin’ around tryin’ to
clear things out to get at him we’re liable to bring
the whole mass slidin’ down on top o’ him and
crush him to death. Anyhow, come on, fellows,
we’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>THE VICTIM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A half dozen men swarmed over the wreck in the
wake of the burly boss and Jeff went along with
them. It was rough going over the mass of débris,
and the tangle of iron and wood seemed to grow
thicker as they approached the point where the
fire was raging.</p>

<p>So close to the flames that their faces felt
scorched, Tim Crowley stopped and got down on
his hands and knees, and with his face to an
opening between some timber that seemed to
reach down into the heart of the mass of wreckage,
he shouted:</p>

<p>“Hello, down there!”</p>

<p>Jeff heard a groan, and then a far-off voice
call:</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, get me out of here or I’ll be
burned alive.”</p>

<p>“How are you caught?”</p>

<p>“I’m lying flat. Just pinned in by wreckage
but my legs are both broken, I think.”</p>

<p>“Legs both broke,” repeated Tim looking up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
at the rest. “How are we goin’ t’ get him out o’
here? We got to do it in twenty minutes or the
fire will drive us away and roast him alive. Come
on, some o’ you men, cut this opening larger if
you can, but be blamed careful because it’s like a
lot of kindling wood an’ if you get too rough the
whole thing will slide down on top o’ him and
crush him. See how that car door wabbles there
an’ that hunk o’ timber is just held in by the end.
It will crush him flat if it all goes down.”</p>

<p>Two men started to cut away at the opening
and Jeff watched them for a moment. Presently
one stopped as his ax clanked on metal and sent
out sparks.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use here, Boss. There’s an iron
bumper underneath wedged in so tight that there
ain’t but a foot or so of room between it and that
truck that’s standing on end. And if we try to
move the bumper the truck will fall right down
the hole through the wood and smash everything
under it.”</p>

<p>Tim looked at the situation and shook his head.</p>

<p>“That’s right. We don’t dare disturb that or
the whole thing will go to pieces. An’ that hole
ain’t large enough for a man t’ git down into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
unless—” he paused and looked at Jeff. And
Jeff at the same moment got the same idea. He
stepped closer and looked at the hole.</p>

<p>“I’m smaller than the rest of you. Perhaps—perhaps—maybe
I could get down and work my
way into where he is if—if the whole thing don’t
cave in on me before I get there.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you. That’s nerve all right,” said
Tim, beaming with almost fatherly pride on Jeff,
“on’y you got to make it in a hurry and git out
again before the fire gets much closer.”</p>

<p>Jeff paused a moment to consider.</p>

<p>“Suppose he’s a big man. Then what’ll I do?
Can’t get him through that hole if he’s as big as
you fellows are,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope he ain’t. Anyhow if you can
get him up near that hole and climb out yourself,
we’ll grab hold of him and try and pry that truck
and bumper apart long enough to yank him
through. Then the whole thing can go to pot
after that. It’s a chance all the way ’round but
it’s better than letting t’ poor chap be burned
to death down in there, which he will be in a
mighty few minutes.”</p>

<p>That thought moved Jeff to action. He took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
off his heavy coat and his lighter one underneath.
Thus stripped for action he stepped down into
the narrow opening between the up-ended truck
and the heavy steel bumper, and slowly, cautiously
let himself down until presently he found
himself standing on something solid directly
underneath the almost tottering truck. In the
semi-darkness of the wreckage he took a survey
of the situation, then shouted:</p>

<p>“Hello, down there! where are you! I’m coming
down to get you.”</p>

<p>A groan and a feeble attempt at a call sounded
beneath him and to his right.</p>

<p>Slowly, cautiously, Jeff began to feel his way
downward through the débris, half crawling, half
climbing, but always feeling first for a secure
footing for he knew that to step on anything insecure
might cause him to fall and his weight
precipitated violently against the wreckage on
either side might cause the pile to collapse and
send the teetering truck and the heavy bumper
down on top of him and the poor victim of the
wreck below.</p>

<p>It was almost painful progress, he moved so
slowly, and it was a journey made hideous by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
perils that were imminent. Already smoke curls
were being drawn through the wreckage by the
draughts down here, and the semi-darkness now
became shadowy with sinister flickering light that
showed between the jagged pieces of timber. Jeff
knew that the fast moving fire was not so very
far off. It would be terrible to be pinned in down
there himself and burned to death along with the
man he hoped to rescue. The very thought made
cold chills creep down his back and perspiration
stand out on his forehead. And added to this
was the terrible horror of being crushed to death
under some piece of timber or steel work that a
slip of his foot might dislodge. Jeff had to exert
all the will power he possessed to keep himself
from any hurried action or any suggestion of
panic, for he knew that the slightest error in
judgment on his part might prove fatal to himself
and the helpless man somewhere down there
below him.</p>

<p>Foot by foot he climbed downward. Twice he
paused to shout and each time the groan and
feeble voice that answered him was nearer. A
third time he paused and called. Then he waited.
But no answer came. Again and again he called,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and then with a shock it was borne in upon him
that the man he was after had either become unconscious
or had passed out while he was trying
to get to him. Jeff came nearer panic then than
ever before. He looked frantically about him
and groped with outstretched hands hoping to
come in contact with the man.</p>

<p>Suddenly from above a flood of light filled the
wreckage. Jeff looked up hastily to discover that
the wreckers had brought an electric battery
lamp and were shining the rays down through the
hole through which he had come. Eagerly Jeff
looked about him, searching, hoping. Then with
a start he discovered a hand protruding from
beneath a board just below him. Beyond the
board he could make out the outlines of a painfully
twisted body, inert and apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>With a shout to the men up above, Jeff
began to climb down again and presently he
crouched beside the man. Hastily, eagerly he
felt inside a flannel shirt. He was still alive but
breathing heavily. As carefully as the limited
space would permit Jeff picked up the limp
form and gathered it in his arms. Then he
started to climb once more.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But if the journey downward called for caution,
the climb back made care even more imperative.
Jeff had to hope that each timber he stepped
upon would bear double his own weight. He had
literally to feel every step of the way.</p>

<p>And to add to the terrors of the situation,
smoke was drawing through the wreckage now in
veritable gusts, and Jeff could hear the roaring
crackle of the fire close at hand. Indeed the
atmosphere down there between the timbers was
hot and choking with gas and smoke. He was
tired, too. Almost exhausted. Every step upward
was an effort. His head bothered him. It
seemed too heavy for his shoulders, and there
was a strange buzzing sound inside. He wondered
vaguely whether he was going to collapse
himself. He realized with a sense of horror that
if he did he would be burned to death in ten
minutes. That thought seemed to clear his head
for a moment, and he climbed more hastily and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
with less caution, trusting entirely to good fortune
that he did not dislodge any of the wreckage.
Upward he struggled. Presently he found himself
once more directly underneath the tottering
truck with its heavy iron wheels. The opening
was just above him. He saw eager hands reaching
downward through it. He wondered vaguely,
whether the man he carried was too big to get
through the opening. He hoped not.</p>

<p>Somehow he stood upright and lifted the limp
form toward the hands that grasped through the
hole. Then his burden was lifted out of his arms
and he saw the apparently lifeless body with its
grotesquely dangling legs moved slowly upward
through the hole and disappear from view. The
hands reached downward again and he reached
up to meet them. A moment he stood there, and
tried to master himself. His head was spinning,
his eyes hurt and his lungs seemed bursting for
the want of fresh air. He tried to think that the
ordeal was nearly over; that in just a minute he
would be out into the cool night once more where
he could gulp down great lungfuls of pure air.
He exerted every bit of will power he had to
master himself, for somehow he knew he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
slipping, that he was fainting, that he was on the
verge of collapse down there underneath the
heavy up-ended railroad truck. And he knew
that if he did collapse no help could save him
from a certain and horrible death.</p>

<p>In a frantic effort he reached still higher toward
the opening. Cold hands touched his,
slipped off, then touched again. One clamped
heavily about his wrist, another reached downward
and fastened onto his sleeve. He felt himself
lifted upward. Then he knew no more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jeff Thatcher came to with the feeling that
there was something urgent he wanted to do,
something he must do before he could rest quietly.
He opened his eyes and looked about and after
a moment he realized that he was lying on one
of the bunks in the wrecking train caboose.</p>

<p>Hastily he sat up and looked about. Across
the car in another bunk he saw another man
lying under blankets, his white face turned toward
him and heavy eyes watching him. There
was something hauntingly familiar about the
face.</p>

<p>The stranger spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“You all right now? Feeling better?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, thank you. And you?”</p>

<p>“I’m done for, I guess. It’s too bad you went
to the trouble and risk of saving me. I’m going
to pass out anyway. Something wrong inside my
chest. But I’d rather die here than be burned
to death down there. It was a heroic thing you
did, boy. They told me all about it.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing. I mean I—I—just had to do
it. It was my job. Say, haven’t I seen you before?
Haven’t I—say, I know who you are.
You’re Roderick Hammond, the—the—cashier of
the First National.”</p>

<p>“Know me, ’eh, in spite of my week’s growth
of whiskers and my attempt to look like a hobo.
Well, you’re right, old boy. I’m the absconding
bank cashier, and the bonds are right here inside
the lining of my coat. You better take them and
return them to the bank for me, will you? And
if there’s any reward you take it. I played in
good luck up until to-night. I’ve been hiding
right under the nose of the police and newspaper
reporters in New City for a month. Why I chose
to-night to try and get away I don’t know, and
why I decided to ride the bumpers of that particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
fast freight I can’t guess. I suppose it’s
one of Fate’s little jokers. Let me go just so far
and then—bing, and it’s all off. I won’t be alive
in twenty-four hours from now, boy. I think a
rib or two has punctured my lungs, so I want you
to have all the glory of returning the bonds and
telling the story. I—”</p>

<p>Jeff jumped down from the bunk with a start.
Now he knew what the urgent thing was he had
to do. Find a telephone and call up Boss Russell.</p>

<p>“Wait a while. I’ll be back. Got to find a
’phone and get this all in to the <cite>Freeman</cite>,” he
said to Hammond. Then, finding his overcoat
which had been thrown over him as he lay in the
bunk, he slipped into it and hurried out of the
deserted caboose.</p>

<p>The first person he met was Tracy, the conductor
of the wrecked freight.</p>

<p>“There’s a signal tower about a mile down the
track. That’s where I telephoned about the
wreck from,” he answered to Jeff’s query and
Jeff, fatigue forgotten, started on a run down the
track toward the blinking red and green light
which he knew was the tower.</p>

<p>“Where in time have you been? It’s three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
o’clock and the first edition is on the press,”
roared Boss Russell when he recognized Jeff’s
voice over the telephone.</p>

<p>“I—I—why—” and then Jeff told him everything
in a wild burst of language.</p>

<p>“Great guns! You don’t mean it. Wait—wait
till I stop the presses. Here, you give that dope
to Sullivan, the rewrite man. He’ll put it in
type. What?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—Aw say, Boss, can’t I write the
story?” asked Jeff.</p>

<p>“Write the story! Why, boy, that story will
be in type and on the street before you get
started back from the wreck. You write the yarn
about the three-legged calf if you have time, but
stick on the job at the wreck there and come
home with the crew. And to-morrow night I’ll
give you the choice of any assignment you want.
That’s a good kid. Good-night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was long after daylight when Jeff, heavy eyed
and weary to the point of exhaustion, staggered
out of the Erie terminal at New City and stumbled
toward a trolley car that would take him
home. He was happy though, in spite of his
exhaustion. He had covered his first big story.
He had gathered all the details and turned them
into the office by means of the telephone, in such
shape that Sullivan, the rewrite man had been
able to grind out three columns of story. Indeed,
as Jeff glanced at the headlines of the copy of
the morning <cite>Freeman</cite> he had bought from the
terminal news stand he realized that he had really
covered two stories, for Sullivan in addition to
writing the story of the wreck had written a
second story on the rescue of the absconding
Third National Bank paying teller, his subsequent
death and the recovery of the one hundred
thousand dollars in stolen bonds, which Jeff had
turned in for safe keeping at the Treasurer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
office of the railroad and asked that they be put
in the company’s safe until word of their return
was passed on to Mr. Davidson, the president of
the Third National, who would doubtless send a
messenger to bring them safely back to the bank.</p>

<p>Jeff had only ambition enough to just glance
at the first page of the <cite>Freeman</cite> as the trolley
car carried him jerkily toward home and the bed
he so much yearned for, and as a result it was
not until hours later that he discovered how Sullivan,
at the instigation of Boss Russell, had told
all the details of the daring rescue of the dying
Roderick Hammond; how a cub reporter of the
<cite>Freeman</cite> staff, with the wreckers, had the courage
to climb down into the perils of the mass of débris
and carry out the unconscious man; how he identified
him, and recovered the bonds, and how in
spite of these achievements he had stayed on at
the wreck all night long, sending in reports
every half hour until all the editions had gone to
press.</p>

<p>In truth, when Jeff woke up, considerably refreshed
at three o’clock that afternoon, and then
for the first time read the front page of the <cite>Freeman</cite>
closely he was surprised and embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
to discover how much of a hero Sullivan had
made him. His name seemed to appear in almost
every paragraph of the story and before he had
read half way through it he paused to mention
to no one in particular that</p>

<p>“The blamed story seems to be more about me
and my fool stunt than it does about Hammond
and the bonds.”</p>

<p>But the real surprise of the whole situation
occurred when Jeff read the last paragraph of the
story. It seemed to hit him a little harder than
all the rest and burn into his memory. It ran
something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“—and the dying man in almost his last breath
told Thatcher that the ten $10,000 bonds were
sewed in the lining of his coat, and that he wanted
Thatcher to return them to the Third National
Bank from which he had stolen them and claim
whatever reward was due him.</p>

<p>“Enoch Davidson, president of the Third National,
when informed by telephone from the
<cite>Freeman</cite> office of the recovery of the bonds at an
early hour this morning, announced that a reward
of two thousand dollars had been offered for the
return of the securities and this would go to the
heroic young reporter of the <cite>Freeman</cite> staff just
as soon as the bonds were back in the bank’s
vault.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Gee whizz. I plumb forgot about that. Poor
Hammond did say that there was a reward for
the return of the bonds and that he wanted me
to get it, but I guess I forgot about it right away
in my hurry to get the story over. Jiminy, I
wonder if that can be true. Two thousand dollars.
Oh, my goodness. Never heard of so much
money except in a bank statement. It can’t be
true. I—I—can’t take it. It belongs to the
wrecking crew more than it does to me. I just
happened to be handy, that’s all. Anyhow, I can’t
return the bonds in person and get the reward.
Left them with the treasurer’s chief clerk in the
railroad office and asked them to get in touch
with the bank. Gee, maybe I shouldn’t have done
that. Maybe I should have hung onto them. But
I was so doggone tired that I couldn’t take the
responsibility for them any longer, so I did the
best thing I could. I wonder if they got back to
the bank or—or—gosh, I wonder.”</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Jeff that perhaps he
had not finished all of last night’s work after all.
Perhaps he should not have been so eager to get
to bed. Perhaps he should have gone right up
to Mr. Davidson’s house and given the bonds to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
him, and then gone home and to bed. He was not
thinking of the reward as these thoughts teemed
through his mind. He was thinking rather of
responsibilities that had been his and that he had
not seen through to the end as he should have
done.</p>

<p>“I’m a poor dub—I am,” he muttered as he
jumped out of bed and began to crawl into his
clothes. “Of course, everything is probably all
right about the bloomin’ old securities, but just
the same it was my job to see that they got back
into the proper hands instead of leaving them to
some one else to take care of while I drifted off
home and went blissfully to bed. I am a fool.
One hundred thousand dollars and I treat it as
if it were a lead half dollar. Oh, my, what a dub.
Now what shall I do?”</p>

<p>Jeff sat down on the edge of the bed and
thought the situation over. Obviously the only
thing for him to do was to call up the bank and
find out whether the securities did get back to
them. His telephone was at the head of his bed.
He picked it up and called the bank number. The
girl at the switchboard of the bank wanted to
know who was calling Mr. Davidson, but when
Jeff said “Thatcher of the <cite>Freeman</cite>,” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
“Oh, all right. Hold the line. He wants
to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Wants to speak to me,” said Jeff to himself
as he held the wire. “I’ll bet he does. Probably
wants to know where I’ve been with those fool
bonds and what I did with ’em. Oh, my gosh.
Why didn’t I take them up to his house instead
of leaving some one else to take care of them,”
and Jeff experienced a sickly sensation in the
vicinity of his stomach as he stood there nervously
waiting for the bank president to come onto
the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello,” boomed a voice at the other end.</p>

<p>Jeff jumped, moistened his lips and tried to
speak. The words came with an effort.</p>

<p>“Mr.—Mmmm—er—Davidson, this is Thatcher,
<cite>Freeman</cite>—you know. Say, did—did—are the—have
you got those bonds? I left them in the—huh—what—you
have? Oh, great. Gosh, I’ve
spent a terrible ten minutes. I just woke up to
the fact that I had not done my whole job last
night, but I was so doggone tired that I guess my
brain wasn’t working full time. You see, Hammond
gave me the bonds before he died,—had me
cut the lining out of his coat and take out the ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
bonds all in a neat little package. Say, I never
knew before that one hundred thousand dollars
could be in so small a bundle. Well, I slipped
them into my inside pocket, and I am afraid I
was so busy after that that I didn’t pay as much
attention to them as I should have, but on my
way back on the wrecking train (poor Hammond
was dead by that time I guess. A doctor from
Granville took him to the Fieldborough Hospital
about four o’clock this morning but he said he
wouldn’t live an hour) I thought of the bonds
again. I realized that it was a heap of money
for me to be carrying around in my inside coat
pocket, so I spoke to Kelly, the chief dispatcher,
about them when I got into the terminal, and he
took me over to the treasurer’s office and introduced
me to the chief clerk who was reporting for
work. He said he would put them in the safe and
notify you, and I thought that would be all right
because I was so dog tired I was afraid I might
fall asleep in the trolley and have my pockets
picked. If I’d have been a little brighter I would
have thought of taking a taxi up to your house
and giving them to you. But I guess my nut was
a little fogged for sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Fine. That’s all right, my boy. You did a
good job. I think you acted wisely. The Treasurer
of the railroad, Mr. Anson, called me up
himself about nine o’clock this morning and we
got the bonds all right. Of course, you know
there is a reward waiting for you down here
amounting to $2,000. Come down and get it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, about that,” said Jeff, suddenly becoming
embarrassed again, “I didn’t call up for that.
I—er—you see, I don’t think I can take that. I
just happened to be the fellow small enough to
get through the hole, that was all. And if I
hadn’t been along one of the railroad men would
have got him out and earned the money, so I think
it really should be divided among Tim Crowley’s
men.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, my boy. No such thing. You earned
it. Anyhow, come down and see me just as soon
as you can. Come down now, I want to talk with
you. About Pennington, you know. I’m very
much interested in the school. It’s my old school,
and I had a talk with Dr. Livingston over the
telephone this morning. So come down as soon
as you can.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’ll come down for that. You bet I will.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
I’ll get my lunch and be down in half an hour.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>Jeff was out of breath with nervousness and
excitement as he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, I guess I was long winded with him
over the telephone, and he’s a bank president, too.
But I had to tell him all about it. And he wants
to talk to me about Pennington. Jingoes—wonder
what’s in the wind. Maybe Dr. Livingston
has decided to give me another chance. Whoops!
I’ll get some lunch and go right down to the
Third National.”</p>

<p>And grabbing hat and overcoat he hurried
downstairs to greet his aunt, a tiny thin little
woman whose face seemed always troubled to
Jeff, but whose disposition was always sunshine
in spite of the fact that she and her husband,
Jeff’s Uncle Frank, had to struggle constantly
to make ends meet. She had kept his lunch warm
in the oven and when Jeff told her all the news
that had developed and she saw quite readily that
he was in a hurry, she made haste to put the food
on the table for him. And Jeff fell to with a will,
for this was lunch and breakfast combined for
him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>BACK TO PENNINGTON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jeff had often seen Mr. Davidson on the streets
of New City and on the few occasions when he
had been in the Third National Bank for some
reason or another, but except for the talk he had
had with him over the telephone that afternoon he
had never really had any personal contact with
him. Somehow he had always gone on assuming
that he was a crotchety sort of an individual, dyspeptic
and irritable and perhaps close fisted and
stingy. In truth, he subconsciously had that
opinion of all bank officials, and the result was
that he was very nervous and ill at ease when he
entered the waiting room behind the glass
paneled door marked President and gave his
name to the girl who occupied the room, and who,
he correctly concluded, was Mr. Davidson’s secretary.</p>

<p>She disappeared into the inner office to reappear
after a moment.</p>

<p>“He’ll see you in just a moment, Mr. Thatcher.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Take a chair, please,” she said in such a formal
way that Jeff, fingering his hat brim nervously,
sat down on the very edge of one of the big
mahogany chairs lined up against the wall, wondering
the while just how he was going to get
on with the town’s most important banker.</p>

<p>Fortunate for the state of his nerves he did
not have long to wait, for presently a buzzer,
somewhere in the room, sounded sharply, and
reminded Jeff of the noise an angry hornet makes
just before it is ready to sting. The girl at the
desk looked up at him and smiled.</p>

<p>“All right. You may go in now,” and Jeff
mechanically got to his feet, opened another glass
paneled door and discovered himself facing Mr.
Davidson.</p>

<p>The banker looked at him coldly for a moment
over the rims of his glasses and Jeff stood awkwardly
in the doorway, hardly knowing just what
to say or do.</p>

<p>Then a strange transformation took place on
the countenance of Mr. Davidson. He smiled,
and in his smile was all the warmth and good-fellowship
Jeff could ask for. Immediately he
felt at ease in the banker’s presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, young man. So you are Thatcher, the
chap the <cite>Freeman</cite> printed so much about this
morning, eh?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” admitted Jeff, “but you see I am
on the staff and I guess that Sullivan, he’s the
man who wrote the story, felt obliged to develop
a hero so he picked on me. I didn’t do a thing
that any other chap wouldn’t have done under
the same circumstances, so I don’t deserve much
credit,” and Jeff’s sincerity concerning his modesty
made Mr. Davidson smile broader than ever.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine way to feel about it, my boy.
But my inquiries, and I have made a number of
them to-day, reveal to me that you are not fully
aware of what you have done. The facts remain,
Thatcher, that you saved a poor unfortunate
from being burned to death and you recovered
one hundred thousand dollars in Liberty Bonds.
It seems to me that these things speak for themselves
and speak rather plainly.” Again he
smiled and Jeff felt decidedly self-conscious and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“You legitimately won a reward of $2,000, my
boy,” went on the banker, “and it is yours if you
care to claim it. You see—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>Jeff interrupted him.</p>

<p>“No, no. I can’t. It is not my place to take
that money. Give it to Tim Crowley who was
the one to discover Hammond pinned down there
in the wreckage. Or, better still, divide it among
the men of the wrecking crew. They earned it.
If they had not come to the scene of the trouble
the bonds and Hammond would have been
destroyed in the fire and no one would have
known a thing about them beyond the fact that
a poor hobo had been caught in the wreck.”</p>

<p>“That’s all true enough and good reasoning,
Thatcher. Somehow it pleases me to hear you
speak that. I am going to see that Crowley and
his men are properly rewarded for their part in
it. But you,—what am I to do about you? Here
is $2,000. It’s yours.”</p>

<p>Jeff hesitated a moment. Then shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t take it. Somehow it doesn’t seem
right. I went down in that hole to save a man’s
life if I could, not to earn $2,000.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine. That’s just what I wanted to hear,—hoped
you would say,” exclaimed Mr. Davidson
jumping to his feet and coming over to
Jeff’s side. He went on:</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to take the $2,000. Not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
now. That is too much money to give to an
eighteen-year-old boy and the fact that you refuse
to take it leaves the way open for me to help you
the way I would prefer to help you,—the way I
had planned to help you ever since Dr. Livingston
called me up this morning. Thatcher, I want to
send you back to Pennington at my expense,—or
rather at the expense of the bank. I will see that
your tuition is paid and your room and board
cared for. Whatever money you need outside of
that you will have to earn yourself as soon as
you are permitted the privilege. Dr. Livingston
assures me you are perfectly capable of doing
that too after this term. Until that time comes
I’ll advance you a little to help out. Will you let
me—let the bank rather, do that for you?”</p>

<p>Just why a strange mistiness gathered before
his eyes and why a lump should rise in his throat
as Mr. Davidson spoke Jeff could not understand.
Nor could he comprehend why he found it so difficult
to say anything without gulping hard to
keep from crying. Somehow the banker’s kindness
simply overwhelmed him. It was the one
thing in the world he wanted most and now to
have it possible seemed too good to be true.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson saw how it affected him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
pressed his shoulder kindly, almost fatherly.</p>

<p>“There I knew you would let us do it. That’s
fine. It pleases me a lot to be able to help you,
Thatcher. I guess I told you over the telephone
that I am an old Pennington boy myself. I
worked my way through the same as you were
doing until—until that mess you got into sort of
killed your chances of staying on for the rest of
the term. I know all about it, Thatcher. Dr.
Livingston told me and how he regretted the
necessity of making you live up to the rules of
the institution. Of course, you realize he really
had no alternative. Rules and laws are rigid
things, my boy. I hope you never have to feel
the seriousness of them any more than you have
already.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment after that and so
was Jeff. Then, suddenly, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“They tell me you are a baseball man,
Thatcher. That’s fine. I used to pitch for Pennington
in my day. I want you to go back there
and make the team this year and I’ll be out to
see you play often. That’s all, boy. Take care
of yourself and write to me the same as you
would to your father.”</p>

<small>“ALL OUT FOR BASEBALL”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Boss” Russell was waiting for Jeff when, a
little later than his usual hour for reporting, he
appeared in the editorial rooms of the <cite>Freeman</cite>.
There was a smile on the usually grim face of
the editor.</p>

<p>“Hello, my boy. Been waiting to see you.
Want to congratulate you and thank you for last
night’s work. We beat the town on both stories.
The first editions of the <cite>Sun</cite> and the <cite>Call</cite> were
out without a line of it and when we bloomed
forth with the news about the wreck and Hammond
and the bonds, they tumbled all over themselves
to rewrite our stories to run in the second
editions. It was great work and I’m ready to do
almost anything within reason for you, Thatcher,—that
is, if you want me to. Mr. Davidson called
me up at my home this noon, however, and told
me that he had a plan for you that sounds better
than anything I can do for you. Have you been
to see him yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“You bet I have, Boss,” said Jeff, still jubilant
over the result of his interview with the bank
president.</p>

<p>“Good. Are you going to accept his proposition?”
asked the editor.</p>

<p>“Why—er—I want to. That is, if it is all
right with you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Boy, I wouldn’t stand in your way a bit.
Indeed, I’ll help you. You can be school reporter
again when—er—I understand there’s a reason
why you can’t handle the job this term.”</p>

<p>“There is,” said Jeff ruefully. “All special
privileges have been denied me and I suppose I’ll
have to sweat out my punishment when I go
back. But I’ll take my medicine the same as I
always have.”</p>

<p>“That’s the boy, Thatcher. And remember, if
you ever want to come back into newspaper work
and I’m still boss here, why just you come and
knock on my office door. But go back to Pennington
now by all means. I’m interested in
that old school, too. Had a son who graduated
from there back in 1910. You don’t remember
him, of course. He played baseball; was captain
in his senior year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, is that so. Bud Russell, wasn’t he?
Shucks, I’ve seen his name on the list of captains
any number of times. Played catcher, didn’t he?
Sure. Gee, I want to make that team this year.
I’m going out for it and try mighty hard.”</p>

<p>“Good, and if you make it, I’m going over to
Montvale and see you play. When are you getting
through here?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible, Boss. I don’t want to
waste a day’s time. I’ll have to plug like the
dickens to catch up with my classes now. I’ve
been out nearly three weeks and it’s getting close
to the end of March now.”</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, you can get through now. No,
work to-night. Dig out that list of obits, run in
on the hospital and—er—yes, look in at the Pipe
Fitters’ Association Ball at Concordia Hall.
Then you can get through. I’ll have a new man
on the job to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Jeff smiling for the
first time as Boss called off the list of his assignments.</p>

<p>And so Jeff made his last rounds of the undertaking
establishments, visited Memorial Hospital
for the last time, looked in at Concordia Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and came back to the editorial rooms, to pound
the old typewriter for the last time.</p>

<p>After his copy had been turned in he purposely
stayed around the noisy editorial rooms for some
time, for despite the fact that he was glad to be
going back to Pennington in the morning, he was
loath to leave that noisy, paper-littered room with
its many busy typewriters, its array of desks, its
battery of clicking telegraph instruments and the
many busy men who were working feverishly to
get out the first morning edition.</p>

<p>But when a lull came in the press of work he
said good-by to his friends on the staff and shook
hands again with Boss Russell.</p>

<p>“Good-by, my boy. Be a good kid and make
the team. Stop in at the cashier’s office and get
your envelope. There will be ten dollars extra
in it for your part in last night’s scoop—shush—not
a word—you earned it.” He held up his
hand in protest as Jeff thanked him.</p>

<p>Then he gripped Jeff’s hand again, very
heartily.</p>

<p>“So long, my boy. Don’t let any one put anything
over on you.” And Jeff left the editorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
rooms with Boss Russell’s last words for some
reason reoccurring in his mind.</p>

<p>“Don’t let any one put anything over on you,”
he mused. “Well, now, I wonder if any one will
try. Shouldn’t be surprised if Gould and Pell
tried to get back at me for a certain unpleasant
affair, but I don’t think they can put much over
on me if I keep my eyes open. Then, again,
maybe I’m too suspicious. Bet they are both
good fellows when you know ’em.” And dismissing
the idea he hurried home and to bed so as
to be up and abroad early in the morning.</p>

<p>It was not a long trip by trolley from New City,
across Wading River bridge and out to the
suburbs of Montvale where Pennington Institute
was located, but Jeff Thatcher, all eagerness to
go back to the old school, was up betimes and off
on an early trolley car. He arrived while chapel
was still in session, and waited patiently in Dr.
Livingston’s office until the Headmaster returned
to his desk.</p>

<p>“Hello, Thatcher,” was the cheery greeting
when he saw Jeff as he entered his office. “Heard
you were coming back. That’s simply bully of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Mr. Davidson. Fine work you did, too, Thatcher.
Er—of course, you realize that you still have a
penalty hanging over you. No special privileges
this term and you cannot leave the school
grounds for two weeks without special permission.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I realize it. I’ll take my medicine,
sir,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Good. That’s a fine chap. Well, let’s forget
the late unpleasantness. Go back to your class.
Take your old room, and no more fighting. I
think Wade Grenville will be glad to see you.
I’ve noticed he hasn’t been in the best of spirits
since you left.”</p>

<p>Wade was glad to see him. So was Buck Hart
and Cas Gorham and Brownie Davis and Rabbit
Warren and all the rest of the fellows, when he
met them at Freshman’s corner, the northeast
corner of the building where for school generations
members of the Freshman class at Pennington
gathered at odd times.</p>

<p>“Whoops, he’s back. He’s here again. Dr.
Livingston told us about it yesterday,” cried
Wade, rushing up to him and pouncing on him
good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, boy, our young hero has returned,” affectionately
shouted Buck Hart.</p>

<p>“Rah for the hundred thousand dollar bond
hero,” yelled Rabbit Warren enthusiastically.</p>

<p>A dozen boys had gathered around Thatcher
by that time, all celebrating his return gleefully
and all wanting to know the details of his brief
adventure in the business world and his thrilling
experiences with the wrecking crew.</p>

<p>And while he was in the midst of this hub-bub
two Sophomores turned the northeast corner and
strolled past the group. Thatcher looked up in
time to look full into the face of Gould. For a
moment he was slightly embarrassed. Then he
smiled and nodded cordially to his former antagonist
indicating very plainly that any malice
he might have harbored had disappeared.</p>

<p>But Gould refused to meet him half way. He
did not return the nodded greeting. Instead he
turned to little Birdie Pell, who still followed him
like a shadow, and remarked with the utmost
sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I see our young movie hero has
returned. The school is saved from certain
disaster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>And Birdie, not always an appreciative audience
for his older companion, refused to laugh.</p>

<p>“The dirty mucker,” exclaimed Wade Grenville
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him wait. Jeff fixed him once. He’ll
fix him again when they go out for baseball.
Jeff, you’ve simply got to win the job of holding
down third and cut him out of it,” said Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try blamed hard you can bet on
that. When is Mr. Rice going to call for candidates?”</p>

<p>“Very soon. I think they are fixing up the
cage in the gym. for indoor practice now. That
means that notices should be posted for candidates
to report mighty soon,” said Buck.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Brownie Davis joined the
group coming from the direction of the gym.</p>

<p>“All out for baseball, fellows. Coach Rice is
just sticking a notice on the bulletin board for
candidates to report in the gym. to-morrow afternoon,”
he said with a great show of importance
at being the first to deliver the welcome news.</p>

<p>“Wow, that listens good,” exclaimed Thatcher
enthusiastically. “Come on, let’s have a look at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
it,” and the group rushed over toward the gym.
and gathered around the bulletin board where
Mr. Rice was just putting the last thumb tack
into his very important announcement.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>“YOU, TOO, THATCHER”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>First call for baseball material at Pennington
Institute brought out a strange and interesting
group of boys all eager to make the team. They
ranged all the way from sub-freshmen and members
of the junior high school to seniors and
members of last year’s squad. They presented
a weird sight too, for the call had emphasized
the fact that there were no uniforms available
that early in the season and that each candidate
would be expected to furnish his own clothes.</p>

<p>The result was a motley array of baseball
clothing, some of it strange enough to make a
seasoned player split his sides with laughter.
Some of the sub-freshmen and junior school candidates
appeared with trousers that were miles
too large and shirts that had to be rolled to elbow
length in order to give their hands the necessary
freedom. They wore caps of various periods of
baseball history, and one chap appeared in football<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
pants and jersey as a fitting substitute for
a real uniform.</p>

<p>There were many among the group, however,
who wore the regulation uniform of the school,
buff trousers and shirt with blue under jerseys
and buff and blue striped stockings. They were
the members of last year’s squad of regulars and
substitutes who had not been graduated.</p>

<p>Among the latter was Gould. He wore the
uniform of the junior team of the year before on
which he had played third base, and he assumed
an attitude of strutting importance as he elbowed
his way through the crowd of students onto the
gym. floor. It was very evident that he felt himself
very much a part of the little group of last
year’s veterans who would compose the foundation
and main support upon which Coach Rice
hoped to build a winning team this year.</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher appeared with the first call for
candidates and he wore a snappy gray and blue
uniform of the New City Y. M. C. A. team, the
state championship “Y” team of the year before.
His appearance in this outfit made a distinct impression
among the younger candidates on the
floor. It made an impression on Gould, too, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
for a moment, upon seeing him, appeared surprised.
But he passed this off with a remark to
one of the older players, which Jeff could not
help but hear, to the effect that:</p>

<p>“Our young million dollar bond hero is all
dressed up with no place to go.”</p>

<p>But it happened that Buck Hart was within
hearing distance and he turned on Gould with a
sharp retort:</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about his not having any
place to go. He’s going after the job of third
base and believe me, there’s one fresh young
Soph who will know all about how fast he’s
going.”</p>

<p>And Gould, not having courage enough to talk
back to Hart, who was one of the best athletes
in the school, discreetly turned his back and
sauntered over to inspect the batter’s cage.</p>

<p>Coach Rice called the fellows to order and lined
them up the long way of the gym. floor.</p>

<p>“My, what a whale of a lot of candidates,” he
exclaimed as he counted them and looked them
over. “Too big a crowd for me to handle in here.
Guess some of you fellows will have to wait until
I call for outdoor practice. For the present I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
am going to take all of your names. Then I’m
going to ask only the old fellows and a few of the
others to report in the gym. The rest of you will
have to wait until outdoor practice begins.”</p>

<p>A wave of disappointed groans went up and
down the line and Mr. Rice smiled.</p>

<p>“Sorry. Wish I could push the four walls of
the gym. out far enough to accommodate all of
you. Then we’d all be happy. Mr. Clarkson, will
you take their names?”</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson was the assistant coach in charge
of the scrub team and as he went down the line
taking the name of each boy he questioned them
as to their previous playing experience.</p>

<p>When he came to Jeff he looked at the New
City Y. M. C. A. insignia on his shirt and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you play with the New City ‘Y’ team
last year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Third base,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Good,” he exclaimed. “We’ll need a third
baseman this year. But you’ll have to work hard
for the job. Wish you luck.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jeff cheerfully.</p>

<p>Finished with the list, he and Mr. Rice went
into conference over it for a few minutes, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the head coach, the list in his hand, walked to the
floor and announced:</p>

<p>“I want only the following boys to report here
every afternoon for indoor practice. The rest of
you, I am sorry to say, will have to wait until the
outdoor practice begins, which I hope will be
about the tenth of April. But cheer up, fellows,
that’s only a little more than three weeks away.
These fellows remain—the rest are dismissed for
the time being—Blackwell, Stone, Daily, Wiggins,
Hart, Gordon, Simmons, Gammage, Sloan, Hecht,
Stafford, Runyon, Daws, Gleason, Dixon and
Gould. That’s all—er—no—you, too, Thatcher,
you stay, please. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Coach Rice paused so perceptibly after Gould’s
name that Jeff Thatcher’s heart sank. For a
moment he felt that he was going to be denied the
privilege of getting the indoor training with the
candidates, which he knew was of the utmost importance
to men who would have to fight for
positions on the team.</p>

<p>Coach Rice had read off the names of all of the
older men on the squad,—the men who had been
out for the team the year before, and had
not intended to add any more new material<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
to the indoor squad. Thatcher was evidently
an after thought and Jeff realized that his “Y”
uniform and the record his team had made the
summer before were entirely responsible for the
addition of his name to the list. Evidently Coach
Rice expected something of him or he would not
have been willing to make him a member of his
already large group of indoor candidates.</p>

<p>And as Jeff walked over to join the squad of
former players who gathered at one end of the
gym. while the rest of the boys disconsolately
filed out-of-doors or climbed into the running
track balcony to watch the start of indoor training,
he wondered vaguely whether he was going
to be able to justify the confidence that his uniform
had inspired in the veteran coach of the
Pennington squad.</p>

<p>Mentally he resolved to do his utmost to make
the team, and as he made the resolution he could
not help but glance toward Gould, whom he detected
looking at him with an unpleasant expression
on his dark countenance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<small>INDOOR PRACTICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Indoor practice was not new to Jeff Thatcher.
He had had a great deal of it for two successive
seasons with the New City Y. M. C. A. team and
he knew all about its limitations and its fun as
well. The Pennington Institute gym. was not a
large one as gymnasiums go and Jeff felt that
Mr. Rice had picked a rather large squad for indoor
work. There were sixteen husky youngsters
capering about the gym. floor, all in baseball
togs, save of course the cleated shoes which were
tabooed. Instead they all wore rubber-soled
basketball shoes to the immediate benefit of both
themselves and the gym. floor.</p>

<p>Coach Rice and his assistant let them amuse
themselves as they chose for ten minutes while
they opened dusty lockers and brought out a variety
of gloves and balls and several bats. When
these made their appearance there was a wild yell
from the squad and they all stampeded in the
coach’s direction and made a wild scramble for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
gloves and balls. Fortunately there were enough
to go around or else those who were slow in a
scrimmage or the least bit diffident about crowding
themselves forward would surely have been
left out of the distribution.</p>

<p>Jeff scrambled with the rest and emerged from
the mêlée with a seasoned fielder’s mitt that had
seen enough service to be as flexible and as well
broken in as the most fastidious ball player could
desire. Indeed, as he slipped it on, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, boy! Look what I drew. That’s a regular
one. Just my size, too, and—”</p>

<p>“Hi, Freshman, that’s my glove,” cut in an unpleasant
voice, and Jeff looked up to find Gould
bearing down on him, his hand stretched out to
seize the glove that Jeff was examining.</p>

<p>Thatcher looked him over coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” he said evenly. “How do you get
that way?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get lippy to me, freshie. That’s my
glove. I used it all last year. I was looking for
it in the pile,” said Gould, with a show of authority.</p>

<p>“Oh, were you? So was I, and I found it first,”
said Thatcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” snapped Gould, crowding
close to Thatcher, with an ugly look in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“What do I mean? Why, I mean to keep it.
And if you don’t like it let me see you get it,
you—”</p>

<p>“Here, cut that, Gould,” said some one, and
Buck Hart crowded his big body in between the
two of them.</p>

<p>“Cut what?” stormed Gould.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush. Don’t try to get away with anything
with me. You want that glove Thatcher got
because you got an old rag. Cut it or I’ll put the
argument up to Mr. Rice. You know where you’ll
come off then. The glove belongs to the man who
gets it first, if he wants it. If you don’t want the
hunk of leather you’ve got, go over and pick another
one from the pile. Don’t try to take anything
away from some one else; especially
Thatcher,” he added with a grin, “because
Thatcher can just about smear your nose all over
your face if he wants to, and you know it. You’re
just trying to make it uncomfortable for him because
you know he isn’t anxious to fight again.
His first fight with you cost him too much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Gould glowered at Hart and Thatcher alternately
and grumbled something about people who
butted into other people’s business, but he did not
have the courage to continue the argument after
that.</p>

<p>“He’s a nasty kid,” said Buck to Thatcher as
he fell in beside Jeff and walked across the gym.
to where Coach Rice was talking to a group of
candidates.</p>

<p>“—and remember,” he was saying, “don’t any
of you be foolish and try to use speed or curves
or anything else. This is just to limber up the
throwing muscles that have been dormant all winter
and are probably stiff and clumsy. I don’t
want any tendons pulled or any cases of Charley
horse or glass arms to start the season with. If
you’ll take my advice you just toss ’em about a
little. All ready, fellows. Come on. Line up
eight men at the south end and eight men at the
north end. Snap to it. That’s right. Now go
to it.”</p>

<p>The fellows lined up along the north end and
spread out across the gym. and presently a hearty
game of catch was in progress in which eight men
from one end of the floor tossed to eight men at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the other end of the floor. But to the slight embarrassment
of Thatcher and the evident displeasure
of Gould, both discovered that the formation
of the two lines of candidates brought them facing
each other. They were on the receiving end of
each other’s throws. Jeff had the ball and for a
moment as he saw who his partner was he paused
and smiled. He appreciated the irony of the
thing.</p>

<p>Gould, on the other hand, scowled unpleasantly
and growled.</p>

<p>“Come on. Throw it, you.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here you are, old sour face,” said
Thatcher, in no way awed by his glowering looks,
and he threw the ball smoothly and evenly down
to Gould.</p>

<p>It was returned with a snap, for Gould must
needs find some vent for the spleen that was in
him. But this did not bother Thatcher. The ball
thumped pleasantly into his glove and the mere
feeling of the sphere and the sound of it as it
smacked against the leather sent a thrill of joy
tingling up and down his spine. It was great
once more to have on a glove and feel the weight
of the thumping ball. He enjoyed the game of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
catch immensely, despite the fact that he did not
like his partner, and he returned throw for throw
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The gymnasium presented an interesting spectacle
then to the fellows watching from the running
track. The air seemed full of baseballs.
Eight snowy white spheres were weaving back
and forth and plunking into gloves with a rhythm
that was blood stirring to the dyed-in-the-wool
baseball enthusiasts who were looking on and
they waxed enthusiastic despite the fact that
they were not working with the candidates.</p>

<p>Despite the admonitions of Coach Rice the
fusillade of baseballs became hotter as muscles
were limbered up and the candidates began to feel
their blood mounting. Again and again he had
to shout at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Ease up there. None of that speed stuff. Cut
it down. Cut it down. You, Hart, cut down on
the steam. Daily, ease up there—<span class="allsmcap">EASE UP</span>—don’t
you understand English? Gould, that’s enough.
Any more of that burning them in and off the
floor you go. Don’t be so enthusiastic. You’ve
got the whole spring and summer to burn up the
air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Thatcher smiled as the coach called Gould down.
He knew that it was not through enthusiasm alone
that he was “burning up the air.” There was the
sting of malice about each snappy throw that
Gould put over and Thatcher realized that his
partner would be perfectly glad if he should by
chance let one of the throws slip through his glove.
Indeed, Gould made catching the throws as difficult
as possible, and Jeff had to be on the alert
all the time to get them as they came speeding in.
But he found a certain degree of pleasure in that,
too, for despite some of the awkward positions
that he was forced to get into to receive the ball,
he got them all and he was glad of the opportunity
to show Gould that he did know how to
handle a glove, even on the first day of practice.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes that game of catch kept up.
Then suddenly Coach Rice blew a whistle and
stopped it.</p>

<p>“All right. That’s enough, fellows. No more
baseball to-day. Form two circles now. That’s
it. Spread out. Mr. Clarkson, you take one group
and I’ll take the other. Get the medicine balls.”</p>

<p>Those big cumbersome pieces of gym. paraphernalia
were rolled out onto the floor, one for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
each group, and presently the fellows were engaged
in a lively game of passing the ball from
one to another. There was no restraint in this
game and the passing became fast and furious, the
heavy ball going around the circles with lightning
swiftness and the fellows grunting each time they
caught or passed the ball. So it kept up, the pace
of passing growing faster and faster and faster,
until all of the baseball candidates were perspiring
freely. Indeed, the sweat was running down
Jeff Thatcher’s face in trickles and he was panting
with the exertion of the work-out.</p>

<p>Suddenly the coach’s whistle blew and the passing
stopped.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows. Bully work-out. Great
pep. Now for the showers and the tank.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” yelled the panting Buck Hart as
he started for the stairs to the basement, taking
off his shirt as he ran.</p>

<p>A wild yell followed and the rest of the sixteen
candidates streamed along in his wake, undressing
as they ran. Indeed by the time most of them
reached the locker room they had but to peel off
their trousers, unlace and kick off shoes and
stockings, and they were ready for the showers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Like a lot of porpoises they streamed inside the
tiled shower room and dashed under the hissing
sprays, crowding, pushing and shoving for a place
under the cold streams of water so that they
could close up their perspiring pores and be
ready for a plunge into the warmer water of
the tank.</p>

<p>With that horde of husky youngsters under the
showers the tiled room rang with the shouts, gulps,
snorts, and screams of pure delight as they
splashed under the cold sprays of almost icy
water. There were spills on the slippery tile
floor, but that did not count for much. There were
squabbles over the proprietorship of the remarkably
few pieces of soap that were in use; there
were water fights and wrestling matches, but none
of them proved serious.</p>

<p>It was Buck Hart as usual who led the crowd.</p>

<p>“Last one into the tank is <span class="allsmcap">IT</span>. Wow,” and he
made a dash for the swinging door that cut off
the shower room from the long tiled room in which
was the swimming tank with its inviting blue-green
water.</p>

<p>Like so many otters they went overboard and
the splashes and yells would have made a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
believe that an army was taking a plunge instead
of less than a score of boys.</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher was overboard with the first of
the group. Diving and fetching up half way across
the tank he came up with a snort and a shake of
his head to clear the water out of his eyes; then,
turning, he watched to see who would be the last
one in. But as he turned, a head bobbed up out
of the water just in front of him, and to his surprise
he saw that the swimmer was Birdie Pell.</p>

<p>“Hello, Thatcher,” said Pell, surprised and
somewhat embarrassed to discover his chum’s
sworn enemy facing him.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself,” said Thatcher, “how’d you
get in?”</p>

<p>“Shush-s-h, I sneaked it. Only baseball candidates
supposed to be in this afternoon, but I felt
like a swim, so I sneaked down.”</p>

<p>“Look out Rice doesn’t catch you,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll keep under water while he’s around
and he won’t be able to find me among this bunch
if he should come in.”</p>

<p>“Duck. Here he comes now,” said Jeff, for Mr.
Rice shoved his way through the swinging doors
and came to the edge of the tank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Pell submerged like a beaver and Jeff, not anxious
to see him discovered, began a prodigious
splashing and milling about with the rest of the
fellows. Out of the tail of his eye, however, he
could see Pell’s form moving under water toward
the spring board float at the far end, and Jeff
knew that the little Sophomore would come up
under the float and stay there until Mr. Rice had
gone.</p>

<p>But the coach did not go. Instead he stood on
the edge of the tank and watched the fellows for
about five minutes. Then he blew his whistle for
attention and shouted:</p>

<p>“That’s enough, fellows. Just a plunge. Turn
out now.”</p>

<p>One by one the boys, with pink, glowing skin,
climbed up the brass ladder at the upper end of
the pool and made for the locker room. Jeff lingered
as long as he dared, for he wanted to see
if Pell would reappear from under the spring
board float. Indeed, he lingered so long that he
was the last one in the tank and Mr. Rice spoke
to him.</p>

<p>“Come on, Thatcher, you water rat. Climb out.
You’ll get another swim to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>There was nothing else for Jeff to do but to
climb out then and follow the coach into the locker
room, leaving Pell alone in the tank and hiding
under the spring board float, where, Jeff knew,
there was just enough clearance between the bottom
of the float and the surface of the water for
a swimmer to float flat on his back and keep his
face out of water.</p>

<p>For some reason it worried Thatcher to leave
Pell hiding there. Twice he looked back to see if
he could see the boy, but he realized that if Mr.
Rice saw him glancing backward that he would
suspect immediately that some one was hiding
under the float and then Pell would be caught.
This Jeff did not want to have happen, and so he
went on into the locker room and said nothing
about the Sophomore, concluding of course that as
soon as Mr. Rice had left the basement Pell would
make his getaway.</p>

<p>In the scramble for towels and the general babble
of the locker room, Jeff forgot Pell for a little
while until he saw Mr. Rice disappear up the stairs
toward the gym. floor. Then he went to the door
of the tank room to pass Pell the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The diminutive Sophomore was standing on the
float poised for a back dive.</p>

<p>“Hi, Pell, he’s gone,” called Thatcher guardedly,
“you’d better come out now.”</p>

<p>“Nix, not if he’s gone. I’m going to have a real
swim.”</p>

<p>Thatcher looked at him in silence for a moment.
He recalled the rules of the school regarding the
swimming pool. No student was permitted under
any circumstances to be alone in the pool. There
must be some other person in the pool at the time.
This provision had been made after the body of
one boy had been found in the pool. He had gone
in swimming alone and something had happened,
and because no one had visited the tank the rest
of that day or that night, his body was not found
until the following morning. After that a strict
rule had been instituted that no boy should enter
the tank alone.</p>

<p>By staying there Pell was breaking this rule.
Jeff wondered whether it was his duty to stay in
the tank room until Pell had finished.</p>

<p>“It is not,” he finally told himself. “If he
wants to break the rule let him. It’s his business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
If he’s caught he can take his medicine.” And he
turned back into the locker room.</p>

<p>He started to dress, slipping into his underclothes.
Then by some strange freak he decided
to brush his hair before dressing further.
On his way to the big mirror at the end of the
room he had to pass the tank room door, and out
of idle curiosity he pushed it open and glanced
inside. Pell was not to be seen.</p>

<p>Jeff stood there a moment puzzled. There was
no disturbance on the surface of the water. Had
Pell left the pool and come in to the locker room
to dress? Jeff did not recall seeing him enter but
perhaps he had come in while he had his back to
the door. Perhaps—</p>

<p>Jeff gasped. As he stood there in the doorway
he saw a hand break the surface of the pool.
There was something horrible, something ghastly
about that hand. It came up with clutching
fingers. It seemed to be reaching vainly for something.
The fingers worked convulsively, closed
upon thin air, then disappeared beneath the surface
again.</p>

<p>“Great goodness, it’s Pell! Something has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
happened to him. He is drowning!” exclaimed
Thatcher.</p>

<p>Frightened almost to panic for a moment, Jeff
rushed through the door and across the tiled floor
of the tank room to the edge of the pool. From
the marble slabs that lined sides and top of the
pool he could see in the green-blue depths little
Pell’s naked body twisting and turning convulsively
under the surface. He could see his arms
outflung and his clawing, grasping hands clutching
and slipping at the smooth tile at the bottom of
the pool. He could see his horribly distorted face
upturned; his bulging eyes stared straight toward
Jeff.</p>

<p>All signs of panic left Thatcher then. He realized
that Pell’s condition was very serious. And
somehow the fact that he alone was there to help
the drowning Sophomore seemed suddenly to give
him the courage and cool-headedness that was
necessary in the emergency.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second he stood poised on the
edge of the pool, then in a beautiful deep dive he
plunged under and with strong strokes swept
down to the bottom and seized Pell by the hair.
The tank was seven feet deep where Pell had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
diving and so it was impossible for Jeff to stand
on bottom. He did however plant his feet firmly
on the tiles and shoved himself toward the surface,
dragging Pell after him and bringing his
head above water, too.</p>

<p>But the half-conscious drowning Pell never
knew what was taking place. Instinct, however,
moved his arms, and his grasping hands closed
around Jeff in a death grip, and before Thatcher
realized it, he was being strangled in a deadly
grasp. Jeff had expected this, and as they both
went under again, he forced Pell’s head around,
pushed his own hands and arms up between the
arms that were entwined about his neck, and with
a superhuman effort, broke the grip. And when
they came to the surface again Pell was so far
gone that he made no further resistance.</p>

<p>On his back and holding Pell’s dragging body
under the chin, Jeff swam toward the brass ladder
and climbed drippingly out. He dragged Pell up
onto the marble coping and then gathered his
limp form into his arms and hurried toward the
locker room.</p>

<p>His appearance at the doorway of the locker
room in dripping underclothes with the white and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
bloodless form of the little Sophomore in his arms
caused consternation for a moment. The fellows
who saw him rushed toward him, exclaiming.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp116">“I—I—think he’s still alive,” Jeff answered</a> to
the hasty questions that were put to him, “but
for Pete’s sake lend a hand here and hurry up or
he will pass out. He’s full of water.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp116">
  <img src="images/i_fp116.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_116">“I—I—think he’s still alive,” Jeff answered</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Right,” exclaimed Buck Hart, lifting Pell out
of Jeff’s arms and laying him on a bench. “Here,
fellows, a little pep now. Take hold.”</p>

<p>Eager hands grasped Pell and followed Buck’s
directions.</p>

<p>First they stood the unconscious boy all but on
his head while quarts of water drained out of his
nose and mouth.</p>

<p>This done they laid him flat on the floor and
proceeded to administer artificial respiration.
Slowly and carefully, but with the necessary vigor,
they worked his arms while they inflated and deflated
his chest with the pressure of their hands.
All of the boys were white and most of them were
very much frightened, and doubtless had it not
been for the cool-headed direction of Buck Hart
and Jeff Thatcher, Pell would not have fared so
well as he did. But they had scarcely worked over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
him five minutes when color began to come back
into his ashen cheeks and his eyelids began to
flutter.</p>

<p>“His heart is getting stronger. Keep it up,
fellows,” said Jeff, who was working his chest up
and down.</p>

<p>“Good. He’s breathing feebly. Keep up the
good work,” added Buck Hart.</p>

<p>And this gave the fellows encouragement, for
they worked with a will, then, and in a remarkably
short time Pell opened his eyes and stared
glassily at the lights overhead.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, I guess we’ve saved him,” exclaimed
Thatcher in a relieved voice.</p>

<p>“I guess we have. But Birdie dear had a narrow
squeak,” said Buck Hart.</p>

<p>“I’ll say he did. Suppose we should send for
Mr. Rice?” asked Jeff, thinking of the coach for
the first time.</p>

<p>“That’s what we should have done in the first
place instead of monkeying around ourselves.
But I don’t think we need to now. He’s coming
through, and if we get the coach here he’ll raise
a pack of trouble for Pell. Let’s not.”</p>

<p>Pell’s eyes were clearing. He was smiling now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and he seemed to understand what the fellows
had been saying, although he did not attempt to
speak. Still they worked over him, and faster
and faster he regained strength and consciousness,
until presently he began to struggle feebly
to sit up. They helped him into a rickety locker
room chair and began to rub him dry with towels.
The friction of the rubbing was as good as a
stimulant to the boy and before long he raised his
head and said weakly:</p>

<p>“What happened? Last I remember I tried a
back dive off the float and my foot slipped. Must
have cracked my head on something.” He felt
of the back of his head and brought his fingers
away with a pink stain on them.</p>

<p>“Guess you did crack your head,” said Buck
Hart, examining the wound. “There’s a lump
there as big as a goose egg and a pretty bad
bruise, too. Believe me, you are lucky, Birdie.
If Thatcher hadn’t dragged you out when he did
you’d be a dead one now.”</p>

<p>Pell looked at Thatcher gratefully.</p>

<p>“Did you save me, Thatcher? Thanks, old fellow.”
And he held out a trembling hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it,” said Jeff, shaking hands;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
“here, get some clothes on. You are shivering.”</p>

<p>Jeff and Buck somehow managed to get him into
his clothes and to get him over beside a sizzling
steam radiator, where they made him comfortable
while they dressed themselves. And Jeff noticed
with a feeling of contempt for Gould that during
all their efforts to bring Pell around the older
Sophomore had done nothing to be of service to
his supposed chum.</p>

<p>“Fine kind of a friend he is,” thought Jeff, as
he was crawling into a basketball uniform that he
intended to use in lieu of the wet underclothing
that he hung over the steam radiator to dry.</p>

<small>ALL OUT FOR BASEBALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But in spite of the efforts of the fellows to keep
Pell’s accident in the pool a secret it became
known throughout the school in a matter of
hours.</p>

<p>Every fellow in the locker room realized that
Pell had been breaking a rule,—a very strict rule,
and while none of them approved of this and in
their hearts felt that he deserved punishment,
they were not willing to go back on him to the
extent of making his misdemeanor and the resulting
accident known. Indeed, while there were
few among them who really cared very much for
Pell they all felt that under similar circumstances
they would want the fellows to stand by them and
they tried to cover up the little Sophomore’s difficulties
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Thatcher and Buck Hart, along with Wiggins
and Dixon, were the most concerned about trying
to get Pell out of the locker room and back to his
room in Newkirk Hall. The rest of the fellows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of the baseball squad left the gym. in twos and
threes or larger groups and went to their rooms,
while these four lingered behind with Pell, who
was still weak and trembling from exhaustion.
The accident had taken a greater toll of his
strength than most of them realized.</p>

<p>“Are you feeling all right now?” asked Buck
Hart.</p>

<p>Pell forced a smile and tried to stand up. But
his legs refused to obey and he sat down weakly.</p>

<p>“Thought I was, but I guess I’d better rest a
little longer,” he said, a little ashamed of his
weakness.</p>

<p>“All right. Rest a bit longer,” said Buck.
Then turning to Honey Wiggins and Dixon, he
said: “Honey, you and George needn’t wait.
Jeff and I will get him over to Newkirk. Fact is,
I don’t think you’d better wait. Four of us helping
him back will look mighty funny. I think Jeff
and I can get him over and be less conspicuous
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe so,” said big George Dixon.
“All right, Hon and I will blow, then. Sure you
don’t need us?”</p>

<p>“No, Buck and I can manage,” said Jeff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Pell looked around the locker room and then
back at Jeff and Buck.</p>

<p>“Where’s Gould?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Gould? Oh, he went out with the bunch,” said
Jeff, and in spite of himself he could not repress
all the scorn that he held for the Sophomore for
deserting his supposed chum.</p>

<p>“Huh,” grunted Pell, after a moment’s silence.
He evidently intended to say more but reconsidered.
Still in that grunt Jeff detected the fact
that Pell’s eyes were opened to the value of
Gould’s friendship.</p>

<p>“How about it now? Feeling any stronger?”
asked Buck as he heard the doors upstairs slam
behind George Dixon and Honey Wiggins.</p>

<p>“Try to stand now,” urged Jeff; “we’ll support
you between us and get you over to Newkirk
and to bed. You’ll get an hour’s rest before the
supper bell and that will brace you up.”</p>

<p>Pell got to his feet once more and walked
slowly, but steadily, to his locker, where he managed
to get into his overcoat and hat. Then with
Jeff and Buck partly supporting him, yet not being
conspicuous about it, they helped him up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
stairs and out of the building into a fast gathering
March twilight.</p>

<p>Across the campus they hurried, as fast as the
weak and still trembling Pell could move. And
under the cover of the half light they managed
to reach Newkirk Hall and get Pell into his room
without encountering any one.</p>

<p>Pell’s teeth were chattering when they bundled
him into his blankets and turned on the steam
radiator in his room. Jeff paused and looked at
him a minute.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, old fellow, you’re shivering so you
shake the bed. Think we had better call Dr.
Stout?”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that,” protested Pell; “I’ll be
all right by supper time, I think.”</p>

<p>But when Jeff and Buck left him they did not
agree with him in that respect.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the shock and exposure and everything
has just about done him up,” said Jeff to
Buck.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to see him have chills that way.
Looks bad to me. But we won’t call the Doctor
unless he doesn’t show up for supper,” said Jeff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>Both boys went to their rooms and made themselves
ready for the evening meal. Wade Grenville
burst into the room, late as usual, and began
to tumble into clean clothes.</p>

<p>“How’s Pell?” he asked, between splashes in
the wash basin in the corner of the room. “Get
him to his room all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we got him there all right without any
one seeing us, but I think he’s a mighty sick kid.
If he don’t show up for supper we’ll have to call
Dr. Stout,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense; he’s a tough little rooster.
He’ll show up, all right. There goes the bell.
Jiminy. Wait up, Jeff, till I put on my collar.”</p>

<p>Both boys made a wild, last minute dash down
the hall toward the dining room, only to almost
bump into Dr. Livingston at the dining room door.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter. Can’t you fellows
shave time just a little closer than this?” asked
the Headmaster sarcastically, the humor of which
was not lost on both of them.</p>

<p>But as they stepped inside the big room, the
door opened behind them and Pell walked in. Dr.
Livingston turned to see who the late comer was.</p>

<p>“Well, Pell,” he said, still with a suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
of sarcasm, “you are nearly as late as Thatcher
and Grenville. Can’t you— Why, what’s the
matter, boy?”</p>

<p>Pell had closed the dining room door behind
him and started on obviously unsteady legs toward
his table. Two spots of color burned in
his cheeks and his eyes were strangely bright.
As he started to step past the Headmaster, he
paused momentarily and tried to steady himself.
Then as he stepped out again he suddenly collapsed.
His trembling legs gave way under him
and he dropped in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston and Jeff reached down and
lifted him to his feet. Then, with the whole school
looking at them, the Headmaster gathered the
boy up in his arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Why, you’re sick, Pell—terribly sick, with a
high fever. Thatcher, call Dr. Stout.”</p>

<p>But there was not need for Jeff to call the
physician. When the little Sophomore collapsed,
Dr. Stout had jumped up from his place at the
head of the junior school table and hurried
through the crowd of boys to the side of the Headmaster.</p>

<p>Together they carried the boy out of the building<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
and across the campus to the infirmary, while
Professor Reisenberg brought order in the dining
room and made the students start on their meal.</p>

<p>Neither Dr. Stout nor the Headmaster returned
to the dining room while the students were eating,
and when the boys left the hall the conclusions
they reached among themselves were that Birdie
Pell was very ill.</p>

<p>And such proved to be the case, for in the morning
it was announced from the chapel platform
that the boy had developed a slight case of pneumonia
and that Dr. Stout had spent the night
fighting to keep it from getting any more serious.
The shock of the accident along with the exposure
had proved too much for Pell.</p>

<p>For two weeks he lingered in the infirmary, with
Jeff and Wade and Buck Hart and many other
boys frequent visitors to his room, when he was
permitted to receive them. Meanwhile, however,
indoor practice had continued with increasing enthusiasm
among the members of the squad of
sixteen. Honey Wiggins, big George Dixon and
Cy Gordon, the pitching candidates, were warming
up to their task of working out their arms, and
with Tad Sloan, the captain and regular catcher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of last year, and Al. Canner and Mickey Daily
acting as substitutes, the three slabmen were
shooting balls across the gym. with real vigor,
sometimes even trying curves and shoots when
Mr. Rice would permit them to unlimber all they
had for a brief period.</p>

<p>A batting cage, almost entirely surrounded by
corded netting, was installed at one end of the
gym., too, and the fellows began to discover how
pleasant it was to swing a bat once more. With
the corded netting draped all around the room to
enmesh a stray ball, the candidates were permitted
to slug as hard as they cared to, and they
went at the work of finding their batting eye with
a will.</p>

<p>Jeff was particularly keen for this batting cage
practice, for he had long ago developed that co-ordination
of eye, brain and muscle that makes a
three hundred batter, and there was nothing he
enjoyed more than proving to a pitcher that there
were few curves or jumps that could fool him.
He noticed, too, with a certain eagerness, that Mr.
Rice had watched him while he occupied the batting
cage, and he felt certain that he saw approval
in his eye as he watched his freedom of swing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and the way he put his shoulders and body behind
some of the smacks that sent the horse hide
against the corded netting with a thump.</p>

<p>Indeed, the coach even went so far after one
slashing wallop of the ball as to remark his approval.</p>

<p>“That’s real stick work, Thatcher. Great stuff.
Wish some of the rest of the fellows would get
the hang of the thing the way you have it. All
you need is to correct your feet a little more and
you’ll be a three hundred hitter some day.”</p>

<p>Jeff was thoroughly pleased to have won that
much praise from the coach and he could not help
smiling with a sense of satisfaction as he stepped
out of the cage to give his place to another batter.
He smiled more, too, when he noted an expression
of jealous hate on the face of Gould.</p>

<p>“That sort of thing gets his goat, I guess,” he
said to himself as he walked over to relieve Mickey
Daily of his catcher’s mitt and his job of catching
the curves of Honey Wiggins. Daily was next in
line for practice in the batting cage.</p>

<p>And so the indoor practice progressed satisfactorily
enough through the last week in March and
the first week in April. The weather was fast developing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
into an ideal spring. The cold weather
that had lingered all too long in March disappeared
completely with the first day of April and
spring seemed to sweep down upon the country
with a rush. Budding trees began to show a fresh
greenness, shrubbery about the campus showed
color that was a source of cheer after the bleakness
of winter. Robins appeared on the broad
lawns of the campus and searched diligently for
worms that were crowding toward the surface in
the damp and rapidly warming loam, blue birds
were awing and their soft, almost delicate song
could be heard from the maples and elms that
lined the driveway. Song sparrows were tuning
up in the woods across the river and the colony
of barn swallows that nested under the eaves of
the library building returned in force.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, this is swell baseball weather,” exclaimed
Jeff one day as, hurrying across the
campus he encountered Coach Rice and Tad
Sloan, the captain, moving toward the baseball
diamond.</p>

<p>“Great, isn’t it?” said Tad Sloan, who was a
short, stocky chap of a quiet but forceful type,
and a senior at Pennington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” said Jeff, wondering with interest
why the captain and the coach were walking toward
the diamond.</p>

<p>Tad evidently noticed the look of inquiry Jeff
shot at them, for he smiled and spoke.</p>

<p>“We’re going over to see how wet the ground
is. If the sun has dried the diamond out sufficiently
Mr. Rice says he will call for outdoor
practice beginning this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, that will be swell,” exclaimed Jeff,
delighted with the prospects.</p>

<p>He hurried on to his classes then, eager to
spread the glad possibilities, and for the rest of
the morning each time he and Wade and several
other baseball enthusiasts passed the bulletin
board in the hall they looked eagerly for the posting
of a new notice there.</p>

<p>And at the end of the last period that morning
they were not disappointed. There it was in big
letters.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">All out for baseball! Squad and new candidates
will report for practice at 3 o’clock.
North field.</span>”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>THE SCRUB TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With the beginning of the outdoor season baseball
practice at Pennington took on an entirely
different atmosphere. In the first place the squad
was increased to more than twice its regular size
with the first day of the season. To be sure it
began to dwindle almost immediately for many of
the new candidates discovered that they were
hopelessly outclassed by the rest of the men, or
else many of them who had just come out to
“fool around” with the squad soon realized that
they were in the way of better players and “cluttering
up the field,” as Mr. Rice good-naturedly
put it, so one by one they dropped out of the
practice and found more pleasure in acting as
spectators than in romping around the field.</p>

<p>So, by the third day of the outdoor work, the
squad had again been reduced by men dropping
out, until there remained about thirty players;
enough to compose three teams with a couple of
substitutes to spare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Immediately this happened Mr. Rice and his
assistant, and coach of the scrub teams, Mr.
Clarkson, proceeded to organize a first team, a
first scrub team and a second scrub team which
amounted to a junior team, composed of the
younger boys of the squad, and after that practice
began in earnest.</p>

<p>Of course, the first team was picked entirely
from among the sixteen players who had taken
part in the indoor practice for the previous three
weeks. Of the sixteen original players Coach
Rice built up a team composed, first of all, of Tad
Sloan, captain and catcher, long Lafe Gammage,
last year’s first baseman still in his old position,
Mickey Daily at second, Buck Hart short stop,
Gould, last year’s second string man at third,
Dave Gleason in right field, Jed Stafford center
field and Dutch Hecht in left garden. Big
George Dixon, the holdover pitcher from last
year, was assigned as the first team pitcher.
This aggregation was called the Penningtons.</p>

<p>The second, or scrub team, called the Penguins,
was built up of the best material available of the
remaining candidates. Al. Canner, the substitute
catcher, was behind the bat catching for Honey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Wiggins or Cy Gordon, both of them second
string pitchers; Dick Runyon held down first,
Cas Gorham played second, Brownie Davis made
the short field, Jeff was picked to fill third, with
Rabbit Warren at center field, Wade Grenville,
Jeff’s roommate, in right field and Fat Daws
holding down the job of left fielder.</p>

<p>Of course, all the fellows realized, and it was
hardly necessary for Coach Rice to announce to
them, that all the positions were temporarily
filled, and it depended entirely upon the ability
and the amount of baseball brains displayed
whether the men would hold onto the jobs they
were assigned to or whether they would move
up to the first team or down to the second team.</p>

<p>As they had been selected, however, both teams
were mighty good collections of baseball talent,
and as it soon proved very evenly matched for
skill and baseball brains. Of course, the first
team had certain advantages because the fellows
were generally older and a little more experienced
in baseball playing, but that did not count for a
great deal when all was said and done.</p>

<p>To be sure it was not the pleasantest thing possible
for Jeff to be classed as a second string<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
man, but he realized that Gould, being a scrub
team man of the previous year had first call on
the third base position.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give him a rub for the place
though,” he assured himself secretly when the
selection of teams had been announced and he
found Gould in the position he coveted.</p>

<p>North Field provided two diamonds, one at the
extreme north end and one at the south end, and
the last named was considered the scrub team’s
home grounds, while the big diamond at the north
end was the home grounds of the first team.
Every afternoon for the first week of the outdoor
practice the two teams turned out upon their
respective diamonds and proceeded to limber up
in earnest. The first few days were devoted to
throwing and batting practice as in the gymnasium,
but in addition to this the coaches took
the fellows for short jogs about the field to
stretch their legs and develop their lung power.</p>

<p>They devoted some of this early work to correcting
individual faults. Mr. Rice and Mr.
Clarkson watched each player carefully, as he
ran, fielded or took his turn at the bat, and whenever
they saw any of the boys making errors or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
developing minor faults they were quick to take
them aside and give them careful and painstaking
drilling until such faults were corrected.</p>

<p>In that way every afternoon of the first week
of the outdoor season was taken up with preliminary
work and it was not until Saturday that
Mr. Clarkson felt that the Penguins were ready
for their first clash with the Penningtons.</p>

<p>It was a five inning game and it was played on
the Pennington’s home grounds with the Penguins
batting as the visiting team and it developed
into a real battle before the fifth inning finally
closed,—a contest in which Jeff Thatcher and
Rabbit Warren stood out conspicuously among
the scrubs. It resulted disastrously for the first
team not in the matter of scores so much as in
the loss of one of its capable group of outfielders.
Dave Gleason went to the bench with an injury
to the calf of his leg; a strained tendon which besides
being very painful threatened to keep him
off the field indefinitely. This happened in the
very first inning and as a result Jeff’s roommate,
Wade Grenville, was the first player to be moved
over from the scrub team to the first team. He
took Gleason’s place in right field and Tiny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Drexel, a diminutive Sophomore and substitute
scrub team fielder was moved into the line up.</p>

<p>Gleason’s injury resulted when he slid for the
plate in the first inning trying to squeeze over
the first run on a close decision. He tallied all
right but when the dust had cleared away he
could not get up. Al. Canner, the scrub catcher,
and Coach Rice, who was umpiring, had to help
him to his feet. He was lying with his right leg
doubled up under him in a position that told
plainly enough that no boy could fall that way
and not suffer as a result.</p>

<p>“My golly, he’s broken his leg,” exclaimed Al.
Canner throwing off his catcher’s mitt and stooping
over him.</p>

<p>“Fine slide, Gleason, but I’m afraid it’s going
to cost you something, poor kid,” said Mr. Rice
lifting his body so that his leg could be straightened
out.</p>

<p>The coach felt of the member carefully while
Dave’s face was distorted with pain.</p>

<p>“Isn’t broken. Ankle isn’t even sprained.
Where does it hurt you, Dave? In there?” Mr.
Rice dug his thumb deep into Dave’s calf and he
groaned with pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Shucks, that’s too bad. I know what it is
now. Pulled a tendon. That means a mighty
painful leg for you for weeks. Guess you’re on
the bench for a while. Here, you fellows, lend a
hand. He can’t step down on his right foot. It
will hurt too much. Lift him. Put his arms
around your shoulders. That’s the way. Take
him over to the bench and one of you run over
and call Dr. Stout.”</p>

<p>Dutch Hecht and Lafe Gammage came over
from the bench and all but carried Gleason back
to the stand where they made him comfortable
while one of the boys on the side lines ran off to
the administration building to get Dr. Stout.</p>

<p>“Wade, you go out and play right field for
Gleason. Clarkson, put Drexel in for Grenville,
will you, please? All right, everybody on your
toes now. I want my team on its toes every second
of every minute of a game.”</p>

<p>The run that Gleason brought over was the first
run and the only run that the Penningtons made
in the first two innings. But it was quite sufficient
to keep the Penguins in second place, for
none of them seemed to be able to find big George
Dixon for anything but the scratchiest kind of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
hit. He fanned the first two men up and while
Brownie Davis reached first on an infield hit and
an error by Gould at third, he stayed there because
Dick Runyon’s best efforts at bat could not
help him any.</p>

<p>Jeff was the first man up in the second inning,
and while he found the third ball Dixon shot over
for a slashing solid smack he did nothing more
than give Gould a chance to retrieve the error
he had made in the first inning. Jeff’s drive was
a hot liner that shot across the diamond about
waist high and looked good for a single, but
Gould somehow managed to get his hands onto
it and knock it down. Then with a snappy
throw he got the ball to Lafe Gammage about
two-fifths of a second ahead of Jeff, thus making
the first out of the inning and smothering Jeff’s
chances to get on base.</p>

<p>Tiny Drexel, who followed Jeff, fanned after
three balls had been waited out, but Rabbit Warren
who was next on the batting order laced out
a clean single between first and second and Fat
Daws followed with almost a duplicate of the
same bingle and advanced Rabbit to third, taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
second himself on the throw to nip Warren which
did not succeed in its purpose.</p>

<p>With two on it began to look as if the Penguins
would have a chance to flap their wings and crow
or utter whatever kind of a noise Penguins are
supposed to utter. But their triumph was short-lived
for Honey Wiggins, while he could handle
a stick better than the average pitcher, was not
equal to the job of bringing in the necessary run
to tie the score. He knocked a long, sky scraping
foul that lumbering Dutch Hecht gathered in with
that serene certainty that marked him as the most
reliable kind of a left fielder, and the inning
closed with Rabbit and Fat Daws still on. The
score 1 to 0 in favor of the Penningtons.</p>

<p>The second inning closed with the big team
unable to find Honey Wiggins for more than one
hit which Captain Tad laced out himself. But
the sturdy catcher was left on third after Lafe
Gammage and Mickey Daily on instructions from
the coach had sacrificed him into the position to
score. Buck Hart was not able to get a hit beyond
the infield and he was easily thrown out at
first by Cas Gorham who fielded his drive with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
ease and threw the ball to Dick Runyon while
Buck was still ten feet from the first sack.</p>

<p>Again the Penguins met a stone wall defense
in the beginning of the third inning and could
not get a man beyond second base. But when
the Penningtons came up for their half of the
same inning it “looked as if the old ball game
was going up in smoke right there,” to quote
Rabbit Warren.</p>

<p>Wade Grenville led off the batting order that
inning and as he stepped to the plate his old
team mates began to josh him.</p>

<p>“Hey, you Penguin, what are you doing in
there?” yelled Cas Gorham.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at our first victim,” yelled Jeff.
“Come on, Honey, put one over for this boy.
We’ve got to get him right off. On your toes
now, every one.”</p>

<p>Honey evidently did put one over with the first
ball pitched but the “victim” refused to be
“got.” Wade leaned on the horsehide with a
smash that sent it cannon balling into left field
and just out of reach of Fat Daws, who made a
good recovery and snapped over a throw that cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Wade off from making more than one base on
his drive.</p>

<p>“Wow, look at that for a starter,” yelled Buck
Hart on the coaching line. “Come on now, fellows,
let’s all be the same kind of victims. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p>Jed Stafford was the next batter up and Honey
Wiggins knew how dangerous this port side stick
artist was and he eased over two balls before he
sizzled across the first strike. He tried to slip
strike two over on the next ball but Jed liked
incurves, which were outs to him and he met the
ball with the end of his bat for a neat little Texas
leaguer over Cas Gorham’s head and just out of
his reach. Wade romped down to second and
Stafford was safe on first by a mile and a
quarter.</p>

<p>The redoubtable Dutch Hecht was up next and
Honey Wiggins knew that Dutch was just as sure
at the bat as he was in the field. For a while it
looked as if he intended to pass the fielder for
he put over three balls in succession. Of course,
Dutch, with natural baseball brains, waited out
the next two just to see if he could draw another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
ball and make first, thus filling the bases. But
when it stood three and two it was noticeable
that he gripped the bat harder and dropped his
shoulders forward a little, ready to land on the
next delivery.</p>

<p>Land he did, but, thanks to Honey Wiggin’s
strategy, he did not land as solid as he might
have for Honey gave him a high one right at his
shoulder and Dutch cut under it enough to shoot
a swift head high drive straight for third base.</p>

<p>Jeff was right in line with it and he did not
need to move to get his glove on it. With a
snappy throw he got the sphere over to Cas
Gorham before Wade could get back to his base
and the result was a double play with Stafford
left on first. That made the Penguins breathe
easier, but they were not out of the woods yet,
for big George Dixon was up for the next man
at bat and he promptly laced out a hit that got
him on first and advanced Stafford to second.
Again the Penningtons had two men on base and
a dangerous hitter up. Captain Tad selected his
bat and walked to the plate.</p>

<p>“Two down, Honey, old boy. Play to this
one,” coached Brownie Davis, and Rabbit Warren<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
from the field yelled, “You’ll pull out of this
yet, Old Stocking. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go is right. Play the batter. He can’t
get anything by us,” encouraged Jeff as he
slapped his hand into his glove and moved out
a trifle.</p>

<p>Drexel, Daws and Warren were moving out,
too, for when Captain Tad leaned on it sometimes
he leaned hard enough to make it interesting
for the fielders. He did this time.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations Honey Wiggins shot
over a swift ball that grooved the plate, and contrary
to expectations also Captain Tad swung
hard at the first ball pitched. There was a loud
crack and Jeff started backward. But the ball
was still mounting when it passed over his head.
He turned and watched Rabbit Warren racing
across the outfield. Stafford and Dixon, running
on anything for the third out, lumber past and
start for home. Captain Tad was streaking
for second as fast as he could go which was very
fast indeed.</p>

<p>Back ran Warren, going as fast as he could
travel and keeping his eyes on the ball over his
left shoulder. Back he ran into deep left field,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and he was still going when the ball started falling
plummet like just ahead of him. Rabbit
made a wild lunge and a dive. The ball plunked
into his glove and he went down and rolled over
and came up to his feet, the ball still gripped in
his mitt. It was the most spectacular catch of
the day and the Penguins and Penningtons went
wild with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Some ball playing for the first day of the
season,” yelled Mr. Clarkson enthusiastically, as
the sides began to change. The score was still
1 to 0 and the fourth inning had started.</p>

<p>And it remained 1 to 0 in spite of the best
efforts of the Penguins, for George Dixon, pitching
in almost mid-season form, still held the
fighting scrubs down through the remainder of
the game and Honey Wiggins, with the fine support
he was receiving from the rest of his team,
tightened up perceptibly and did not let the first
team squeeze in another tally. For the first game
of the season it was a fine exhibition of baseball
and the eighteen players left the field bubbling
over with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The locker room in the basement of the gym.
was an interesting place when the whole squad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
gathered there to change their dusty and sweaty
uniforms for more appropriate clothes for the
dining hall.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, that was a great catch you made,
Rabbit, old boy,” said Jeff enthusiastically, slapping
his friend on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, I had to match that double play you
pulled, didn’t I?” said Warren grinning from
ear to ear.</p>

<p>“Sure you did, you old Indian. I begin to
think we’ve got a better team than the first team
at that. Notice how anxious Coach Rice was to
get Wade over on the other side just as soon as
Dave Gleason pulled a tendon. Poor Dave.
Heard anything from Dr. Stout?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” yelled Buck Hart from another section
of locker, “I passed him coming in and he says
Gleason has a mighty mean leg. He’ll have to
use a crutch for a week or two or perhaps
longer.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, that’s too bad for Gleason. But the
Penningtons needn’t worry. We have lots of
bright young men on the Penguins ready to step
into the breach. Look at Rabbit Warren, for
instance. Why, he’s the original skyscraper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
When they won’t come down to him he flies up
and gets ’em. He’s been putting hair tonic on
his shoulder blades, and hanged if I don’t think
he started to grow wings the way he climbed up
for that one to-day. Give him time and he’ll
be—”</p>

<p>Further remarks of a similar nature were cut
short from Jeff by a sweater that came sailing
through the air and wrapped neatly about his
head. When he unwound it Rabbit Warren was
grinning at him.</p>

<p>“No more publicity this evening, Jeff. That’s
a good job for one day. You’ll talk me onto the
first team yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, believe me, if Wade Grenville wasn’t
rooming with me he wouldn’t have made it
to-day. See what I did for him. Why, Rabbit,
you wouldn’t believe it, but I make Wade stand
on the bed every night and catch glasses filled
with water. If he spills any he has to sleep in a
wet bed. That’s why he’s such a good fielder.
How about it, Wade?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you old sleeper, you. All the practice
I ever get from you is practice in how to snore
in three languages. Fine lot of help you are to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
me. I’m thinking of changing my room now that
I have advanced to real company. That Penguin
outfit is some bunch of birds. They know about
as much about baseball as—”</p>

<p>Wade did not get any further before several
members of the scrub team began to bombard
him with everything from catcher’s mitts to baseball
shoes and he had to beat a hasty retreat into
the shower room.</p>

<small>A STIFF SCHEDULE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That Saturday afternoon game was the first of
a series of five inning games between the Penningtons
and the Penguins that extended over a
period of just one week; the first week preceding
the opening of the season for the Pennington
team with the game with Erasmus Hall which was
dated for April 21st. And it was during these
games that the Penguin players, Jeff Thatcher
included, hoped to make sufficient impression on
Coach Rice to be allowed to play at least a part
of the first game.</p>

<p>The result was a veritable whirlwind series in
which the Penningtons and the Penguins fought
it out from the first ball pitched to the last batter
up. And to give the scrub team credit, it was
composed of such high caliber material that in the
seven games played they won and tied three
games, only permitting the first team a clean cut
victory in the first game of the series and in the
fourth; that played on Wednesday afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
when the first team closed the fifth inning with
a rally that all but completely rattled Cy Gordon,
the youngest of the three pitchers, and caused
him to let them pile up four runs in the one
inning drubbing the scrubs to the tune of 6 to 1,
which was the worst beating that either of the
teams had suffered.</p>

<p>The Pennington schedule was a stiff one; according
to Coach Rice the hardest they had had
in years, for it provided for two games a week
and in some weeks three games were scheduled.
It began with the Erasmus Hall game, which
was not a big game but usually an interesting one
for the school from Flatbush brought down to
Montvale an aggregation of scrappy ball players
who fought for every run and every out, and it
was generally considered an excellent game on
which to test the mettle of the team from the
bigger institution. Following the Erasmus game
came a number of games of more or less importance
ranging from the East Winton and New
City Y. M. C. A. teams to the game with the
Princeton Freshmen which occurred about the
middle of May. That was the first of the really
big games and from then on the Pennington team<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
was supposed to keep going in full stride through
the rest of May and on to the middle of June
when the climax of the baseball year was reached
in the game with Lawrencetown, an institution
of about the same scholastic standing as Pennington
and jealous of annexing the State Championship
each year. It was generally a fight between
the schools for this championship and the
game was rated of such great importance that
although the ’varsity P was awarded for baseball
to a player who had played in seven games of
the season one of the seven must needs be the
Lawrencetown contest. So, of course, the objective
of all the members of the Pennington baseball
squad was to become of so much importance
to the team that the coach would feel it quite
necessary to include them in the batting order of
the team when it faced Lawrencetown.</p>

<p>And Jeff Thatcher was not the only one who
realized that it was never too early to begin fighting
for that objective and that is the reason why
he and several others of the scrub team put
everything they had into the first five games of
the practice season. Indeed, he and Rabbit Warren
played such heady baseball and handled their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
bats so well that in the last game of the series
on Friday afternoon, they were both shifted to
the first team as a temporary expedient by Coach
Rice, just by way of determining whether the
Penningtons could be made any stronger with
them in the batting order.</p>

<p>Friday’s game proved to be a terrific contest,
and for four innings it went on a scoreless tie
with both teams fighting a terrific battle for
supremacy. In the first half of the fifth inning
Al. Canner, the Penguin catcher, laced out a
three-bagger from one of Dixon’s deliveries and
Cas Gorham followed him immediately with a
single that drove home the first run of the game.
It looked to Jeff then that his old friends of the
Penguins were set up to win another game, and
win it without his help. But Dixon tightened up
and struck out the next two men and caused
Gould, who was playing in Jeff Thatcher’s place
on the scrub team, and accepting his reversal
with very bad grace, to raise a high fly into Rabbit
Warren’s hands. That retired the side and
the Penningtons came to the bat full of fight but
one run behind their juniors.</p>

<p>Lafe Gammage was the first man up and Long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Lafe poled out a single first crack out of the box,
finding one of Honey Wiggins’ air tight curves
to his liking. Mickey Daily followed him with a
bunt which rolled down the third base line and
was retrieved by Gould only just in time to throw
him out at first. But Lafe arrived safely on
second. Buck Hart was up and Jeff Thatcher
was on deck. It was up to either one of them to
bring in that single run and tie the score, if they
could not do more.</p>

<p>Buck tried very hard indeed, but the best that
he could do was send a sizzling liner at Brownie
Davis who almost succeeded in making a double
play of it, whipping the ball down to Dick Runyon
so fast that Dick had plenty of time to snap it
back to Cas Gorham who narrowly missed touching
Lafe Gammage out as he slid back to second.</p>

<p>It was up to Jeff then. There were two out and
a man on second and one run needed to tie the
score. Jeff weighed two bats methodically as he
walked to the plate. Outwardly he appeared very
calm, but inwardly he was as nervous as a cat.
Could he do it? he kept asking himself as he
stepped up to the rubber. But the moment he
squared away to face Honey Wiggins the nervousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
left him and he felt as calm and collected
as if he were about to recite a lesson in the class
room.</p>

<p>“Get this baby, now,” he heard a mean voice
coach from third base and he turned his head to
see Gould glowering at him. Jeff smiled then
and down in his heart he resolved to make good.</p>

<p>He watched Honey Wiggins as he squared
away in the pitcher’s box and took the signals
from Al. Canner.</p>

<p>“Come on, Honey,” coached Canner. “This is
the only one you have to put away and the game
is ours. Easy meat.”</p>

<p>Honey wound up. Jeff gripped the bat and
moved his body slightly forward. The ball came
whistling toward him. It was a wide breaking
out curve and Jeff knew that it would shoot over
the rubber for a strike. He was not easily fooled
with a wide out and he measured with calculating
eye and struck.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful line drive straight at Gould,
and it had all the force behind it that Jeff’s powerful
arms and shoulders could muster. Gould
lunged for the ball. It hit his glove, bounced
high and went on into the outfield for a single.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Big Lafe was making his long legs go like a
windmill as he raced down the third base line for
home. He made it standing up and Jeff was
safely on second before Fat Daws could throw in
to Brownie Davis. The score was tied. Jeff had
accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p>It was well that he had, too, for Wade Grenville,
who followed him in the batting order got
Honey Wiggins in a three and two hole and then
for some unaccountable reason reached for a wide
one and sent a grounder down first base line for
the third and last out of the game.</p>

<p>“That was a bone head play of mine,” said
Wade when both he and Jeff reached their rooms.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you reached for it,” confessed
Jeff. “If you had passed it up you would have
walked.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Jeff, but somehow I thought I
could pole out a safe single over Dick Runyon’s
head and perhaps get you home on it.”</p>

<p>“A laudable ambition, Old Scout, but I wish
you’d played safe. Now if I had pulled that,
why—”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it, Jeff. Quit kidding. Say, that was
some smash that you shot down to Gould. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
handled it as if it was a hot potato and it looked
as if it might have been real hot at that.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was, Wade. I was afraid I was a
goner at first. It headed right for his mitt. I
didn’t realize it had so much steam on it until I
saw it bounce off his glove. Jiminy, I’ll bet he’s
so mad he could eat nails and not notice it.”</p>

<p>“It’s great work, Jeff, old fellow. I’m mighty
glad to see you get a chance at the job. I think
Coach Rice has got his eye on you for it at that.”</p>

<p>“But Gould is pretty good,” confessed Jeff.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. But I think you are just a shade
better. And goodness knows your disposition
is—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but disposition don’t count so much in
baseball,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you fool yourself, Jeff. It counts
a heap. I’ll bet a doughnut hole that Gould can
go up in the air and get mad quicker than any
man on the team when he’s losing. And when a
man blows like that, why he isn’t much good to
the team until he gets his feet on the ground.
Now is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’re right, Wade.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps? I know I am, Jeff. Keep up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
good work. I hope Mr. Rice gives you a chance
in the Erasmus Hall game to-morrow. Perhaps
he will. Hope he starts the game with you.
Can’t tell. He might. My, but wouldn’t Gould
be peeved if he did? Anyhow, I’ll say you are a
likely substitute.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<small>ON THE BENCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But Wade’s hope was not realized. Jeff and
Rabbit Warren and Cas Gorham were among the
substitutes whose names appeared on the bulletin
board with the regular team the next morning.
Of course, Honey Wiggins and Cy Gordon, the
two extra pitchers, were also among the second
string men called into uniform, but their names
along with those of Jeff, Rabbit and Cas Gorham,
appeared very definitely under the list of “substitutes.”
For some reason Jeff had a feeling
of discouragement when he realized that Coach
Rice did not yet recognize him as having first-team
ability and for a few minutes he was inclined
to grouch and feel peeved about it. But
his better sense soon dominated the situation and
made him realize that he, a Freshman, should be
listed as a substitute and Gould given the position
at third if for no other reason than that the
Sophomore had devoted all the previous season
toward trying for the job, and evidently had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
willing to play on the scrubs for an extended
period just to be in line for the job this year.</p>

<p>“Gould is good,” he acknowledged to himself,
as he stood in front of the bulletin board and
mentally disciplined himself. “Just because he
is hot tempered and ugly; just because I do not
think so much of him and most of the fellows of
our bunch don’t like him is no reason why he
shouldn’t be playing third base. For a while the
best I can expect, I guess, is to be a sub on the
big team and just hope to get a show once in a
while. I’ll bet just hanging around like that is
going to get Gould’s goat. Blame it, I want his
job and, believe me, I’m going to make myself so
good that Coach Rice will have to give me more
than a substitute’s show. I’ll just—”</p>

<p>“Wow, I knew you’d get a chance, first shot,”
said some one behind Jeff, and turning he discovered
Wade looking at the bulletin board.</p>

<p>“Knew I’d get a chance? What do you mean?”
asked Jeff.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor fish, don’t you see your name
on the list?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it there. But look just above it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
See that word. It reads s-u-b-s-t-i-t-u-t-e. Can’t
you read?”</p>

<p>“Well, what does the young man want? Does
he want to be crown prince or emperor or what?
My goodness, Jeff, it’s something to be in uniform
and on the bench. I think if you get that
far you’ll get a chance in the game. Anyhow,
you are making progress.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do want too much. But look at
you, you lucky duck. Make the first team right
off.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a combination of luck and circumstances.
If Dave Gleason hadn’t pulled a
tendon and if the rest of the fellows out for fielding
positions were just a little more lucky I’d be
warming the bench this afternoon myself. Just
luck, old kid, and I’m afraid that it won’t last
any too long. Rabbit Warren is moving along
too fast to make me very happy. First thing I
know they will bench me and shove him in. I
wouldn’t be surprised if it happened to-day. I
bet you and Rabbit will get a show before the
game is over. So will Honey Wiggins.”</p>

<p>But Wade’s prediction was only partly right.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Honey Wiggins did get a chance. Coach Rice put
him in in the seventh inning because he did not
want George Dixon to go the entire route and
possibly strain his arm. But Honey was the only
one of the five substitutes who did get a chance.</p>

<p>Gould played an air-tight game, fielding one
hundred per cent and getting two hits out of five
times up, and drawing a pass once. Whether the
presence of Jeff inspired him to do great deeds
just to show the aggressive Freshman that he
hadn’t a chance in the world for the job, or
whether he was improving so steadily that he was
fast reaching the top of his form Jeff could not
guess, but certainly he played brilliant and heady
ball in every inning but the ninth. His success
seemed to make him more cocky than ever then,
and he all but started a fight with the man on the
Erasmus Hall coaching line. They exchanged
words that fairly made the air sizzle with their
sharpness, and Gould was all for fighting it out
there and then until Umpire Stephens came over
and stopped the argument with a threat to put
both Gould and the other offending player off the
field if they did not hold their tongues.</p>

<p>On the bench, beside Mr. Rice, Jeff could see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
that Gould’s nastiness did not please the coach at
all. He frowned and looked very much displeased
while the argument was taking place, and Jeff
heard him remark to Mr. Clarkson:</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of that boy. He’s mean
clear through sometimes. If it wasn’t that he
deserved a chance, and that he is a fair enough
third baseman I’d throw him out of the squad.
I’d yank him out now if the game wasn’t so
nearly finished, just to show him that I will not
stand for fresh players on a Pennington team.”</p>

<p>But the inning closed with the next out and that
was the end of that, and Jeff and Rabbit and Cas
Gorham wended their way to the locker room
more or less discouraged with their luck.</p>

<p>On their way across the campus Jeff noticed
a boy coming slowly out of the infirmary door.
He was bundled in a heavy coat despite the
pleasant spring warmth of the day, and he looked
thin and hollow-eyed. Jeff had to look at him
twice before he recognized him.</p>

<p>“Well, hello,” he exclaimed, “if it isn’t Birdie
Pell. Up and around now, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, up, but not very much around. I feel
as weak as the dickens and I can’t go very far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
or do very much without getting disgustingly
tired out. I wanted to get over and see the game
to-day but Dr. Stout would not let me. Said I
would have to be content with just strolling in
the sunshine for a week or so before I get on my
feet again. How did the game turn out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we trimmed ’em, 8 to 5, but it was a good
game at that. They have a whale of a pitcher
in Jack Sibley. Long, lean southpaw who can
make a ball do most anything. He had our fellows
buffaloed for about four innings. Then
they got to him in the fifth and hammered out
five runs before he steadied down. I guess they
did not have another man to put in in his place
or they would have derricked him. They have a
good team though. A little ragged in spots and
that’s about the only reason why we beat them.
When they get in mid-season form they are going
to be some team, let me tell you. I believe they
will be able to give the Princeton Freshmen a
rub. They play each other some time in May.”</p>

<p>“Did you play?” Pell asked, and there was
something about the question that made Jeff
wonder just what the little Sophomore was thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“No, I was on the bench. So was Rabbit and
Cas here. Gould played third and played a dandy
game,” said Jeff, generously giving his rival full
credit.</p>

<p>Pell looked at Jeff quizzically for a moment.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Shucks, I’d love to have seen the game. But
I may see the Sweetwater game next Saturday if
I am good and get back some strength.”</p>

<p>“Hope you do,” said Jeff moving on to catch
up to Rabbit and Cas.</p>

<p>“Pell looks as if he had had a tough time of
it, doesn’t he?” said Cas.</p>

<p>“Seems to have changed a heap, too,” said
Rabbit Warren. “He used to be a blamed fresh
kid, always hanging out with Gould. They made
a fine pair. I think Pell has been flattered by the
companionship of Gould and, believe me, Gould
has been just wise enough to work little Birdie
for all he is worth. I wonder if they are as thick
as they were? Haven’t noticed Gould wearing a
path to the infirmary door visiting Birdie, have
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Cas Gorham, “and I think
Birdie realizes, too, that Gould isn’t such a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
friend as he pretends to be. I think it sort of
hurts his pride or something or other. He seems
different. Isn’t as cocky or fresh as he used to
be when he teamed up with Gould. Used to be
a regular blamed pest; fresh as they make ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t fret, they’ll be back together again.
Birds of a feather, you know. Pell’s close call
has taken some of the wind out of his sails, but
I’ll bet he’ll be just as fresh as ever once he gets
on his feet again and gets his running mate
Gould along with him,” said Rabbit Warren
skeptically.</p>

<p>“Well, now I don’t know about that,” defended
Jeff. “Gould didn’t even lend a hand when Pell
was in that pickle down in the locker room. Buck
Hart and I had most of the disagreeable work to
do. Not that the rest of you fellows didn’t want
to lend a hand and didn’t offer to help out all
you could. That was all right. But why didn’t
his good friend Gould look after him? I think
Pell, as sick as he was, noticed that Gould had
gone back on him and I’m inclined to think he’s
through.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you fret. You just wait and see if
I’m not right. When Pell gets around again his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
freshness will all come back, and when he gets
that way Gould is about the only fellow in school
who will stand for him.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Pell is naturally a pest or whether
his association with Gould made him so. I mean
by that, Gould is a fresh duck himself and I’m
half inclined to believe that Birdie Pell has just
aped Gould all the way. Tried to be as big and
as boastful as his pal. I wouldn’t wonder but
that if Pell got to traveling in decent company
he’d be a fair sort of a fellow himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you are right,” said Rabbit,
“but you’ll have to show me. I can’t believe it
until I see it work out that way. And one thing,
I won’t take the little pest under my wing to try
and make a regular fellow out of him. It would
be too much of a contract, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>For some strange reason after he returned to
his room that night Jeff thought a great deal
about Birdie Pell and what Rabbit Warren and
Cas Gorham had said concerning him. He wondered
after all whether they were right or
whether he was right in thinking that perhaps
Pell was a likeable sort of fellow if he once got
out of the company of Gould. He was half inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to believe that he was more right than
either of the other two boys, but he realized that
he was hardly in a position to provide the right
sort of company for Pell since he was a Freshman
and Pell was a Sophomore. Pell would naturally
chum with the Sophomore bunch and probably
held the same ideas about Freshmen that the
rest of the Sophs did. Jeff, however, decided to
watch developments in Pell. He even went so far
as to contemplate approaching Dal Hoffman and
several other Sophomores whom he knew more or
less intimately and liked because they were good
wholesome fellows, suggesting perhaps that if
they were willing to tolerate Pell’s company for a
little while they might develop him into a regular
fellow and a worth-while sort of a chap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<small>GOULD IS SET DOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But Jeff never made the suggestion to Hoffman
and the other Sophomore friends he knew intimately,
first of all because he thought it was a
rather delicate matter to handle without considerable
deliberation. And by the time he got
through deliberating he discovered that the prediction
that was made by Rabbit Warren was in
a fair way toward being fulfilled. Birdie Pell
and Gould were chumming together again, and
Birdie was apparently developing into just as
much of a nuisance because of his freshness as
he had been before his accident in the swimming
pool.</p>

<p>Birdie had hardly been definitely discharged
from the infirmary before Jeff discovered him
one evening strolling with Gould toward the
shadows of the gymnasium building around
which they disappeared. Jeff knew as well as if
he had been told that the two of them were on
their way toward the back road that led across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the Wading River bridge to the woods on the far
side which was out of bounds and so much out of
the way that they could plan to do almost anything
and not be detected. They were going to
the woods to sneak a smoke. They were up to
their old ways again and Jeff watched them in
disgust. Anything that one had to sneak out of
bounds to do was hardly worth doing to Jeff’s
way of thinking.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I believe Rabbit was right. Birds
of a feather do flock together. It looks as if they
were both tarred with the same stick. And Gould
is the worst of the two because he is older and
should have more sense. He is leading that kid
into trouble and I’m afraid Pell hasn’t the backbone
to say no to anything.”</p>

<p>Jeff was thoroughly disgusted with both of
them after that and gave the redemption of Pell
very little thought. He had too many other
things to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>Spring was coming on with a rush. The first
of May arrived with all the balminess that that
delightful month can bring. The majestic old
elms and maples on the campus were a brilliant
green now with lush young leaves, the ivy that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
sprawled over the brick walls of the school buildings
was colorful with new leaves and bright
green tentacles that were reaching out for new
places into which to hook their tiny fingers. All
of the birds were back now, even the sputtering
wrens that nested in the bird boxes that the students
of another generation had erected around
the school grounds, and tiny warblers of all
descriptions were whisking from one tree to
another diligently seeking worms and worm eggs
and thus clearing the fine old trees of any breeding
summer pests that might destroy them. It
was great to be alive such days.</p>

<p>It was baseball weather, too; baseball weather
of just the right sort and all of Jeff’s otherwise
unoccupied time was devoted to thoughts of the
game and his efforts to develop himself into a
permanent member of the first team. He had not
missed a single day’s practice since the call for
baseball candidates had been issued, and he had
devoted himself conscientiously to the work of
rounding into excellent physical shape and his
best playing form.</p>

<p>And his efforts had not been without recognition
either, for Coach Rice and Mr. Clarkson had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
been watching him with critical eye ever since he
had been a member of the squad, and they had
both gone to great pains to help him in his efforts,
giving him suggestions and pointing out minor
faults in his form which when corrected went a
long way toward making him a better all around
player.</p>

<p>Since the first game of the season with Erasmus
Hall he had been accepted as one of the regular
substitutes for the big team, and every Wednesday
and every Saturday thereafter his name appeared
on the bulletin board with those called
out for the game. Indeed, by the end of the
second week in May he had played in three games,
once substituting for Mickey Daily on second
base for an entire game, when that sturdy little
streak of lightning had to go to the infirmary
with a slight case of tonsilitis, and twice being
put into the game for Gould at third base when
Mr. Rice felt that perhaps the team would work
better with the substitution than with the regular
player.</p>

<p>Of course, Gould was none too pleased with
these changes that kept him out of the batting
order and he made manifest his disagreeableness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
in various ways much to the disgust of Jeff and
the rest of the members of the team who were
not at all partial to having him in the game. But
it was a notable fact that the next game following
the games in which Jeff had played, Gould put
up a much better exhibition of baseball. He
seemed to have it in him to play harder, as if he
meant to show Mr. Rice and the rest just what
he could do when he tried. Jeff noticed this with
the rest of the fellows of the team, and the coach
as well, and he came to the same conclusion as
the rest of them did; that Gould was not giving
his best to the team only when he had to.</p>

<p>If there was anything that made the head
coach angry it was just that fault in a player.
His instructions always were, “Play it hard, no
matter how easy the game. Play everything
hard.” And when he found a player softening
up on his play, or trying grand stand stuff, or
showing off in any way he was the first to call
that player down.</p>

<p>That is what he did with Gould after the Fayville
High School game. As the Sophomore was
getting dressed in the locker room the coach sent
a boy downstairs to tell him that he wanted him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
to report to his office. Gould reported on his way
out of the building and the coach treated the third
baseman to one of the severest lectures that he
had delivered to any boy and Gould in humiliation
became very surly and ugly, and answered back
in a manner that was decidedly disrespectful.</p>

<p>“Look here, Gould,” said the coach, concluding
the grilling he was giving the Sophomore.
“You are a fair baseball player when you want
to try. But it isn’t very often you want to try,
it seems to me. I’m about sick of it. I think you
are not putting enough of yourself into the game.
You are not giving enough of yourself to the
team. You are just giving enough to slide by
and that isn’t what I want. I want a fellow to
play hard all the time. Play everything hard.
You know that as well as I do. Let me see your
hands.”</p>

<p>Gould wonderingly held out his hands. Mr.
Rice looked at them closely.</p>

<p>“Hum, just as I thought. Trying to slide by.
Giving some of your physical resources to smoking,
eh? Oh, don’t try to deny it. I’ve suspected
it for a long time and now I’m convinced. That’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
nicotine on your fingers, isn’t it? You are one
of those chaps who sneak out of bounds every
night after supper and steal a smoke or two.
Gould, you can’t match baseball against cigarettes.
Every time you smoke you give just so
much of your physical energy and resource to
tobacco and you have just that much less to give
to the team. You have doubtless hurt your wind
and your heart by smoking. You have slowed up
your brain just a little. Your eyes are a little
duller. The coördination of your muscles isn’t
quite so keen as it should be. You are lazy and
willing to let down except when you have to exert
yourself, and the exertion costs you just a little
bit more than it does a boy who doesn’t smoke.
I knew I’d find the answer to it all in cigarettes,
or late nights or both. I’ve watched too many
boys these years past to let you put anything like
that over on me. I am sorry it has come to this,
Gould, but until you can give me one hundred
per cent of yourself, until you can give the team
and the school all your interest and not divide it
with cigarettes and pleasures, you will have to
go back in the line of substitutes and give your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
position to a fellow who is willing to play hard
and work hard, and give all his interest to the
school, the team and to me.”</p>

<p>Gould was sullenly silent for several minutes
after the head coach had stopped talking. Then
he moistened his lips and spoke:</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Rice, you are accusing me of
something that you are not certain of. Those
yellow stains on my fingers may not be nicotine.
Suppose I said it was iodine; that I hurt my
finger in practice yesterday. What about that?”</p>

<p>“Why, if you told me that, Gould, and looked
me in the eyes as you told me, perhaps I would
believe you. But that wouldn’t make me change
my opinion that you have not given everything
you have to the team except when you had to.
And I’m sick of such tactics. From now on you
will have to fight for your place in the sun; your
place on the team. You’ll have to give everything
you have to the team or you will not be in the
batting order very frequently. Saturday I am
going to keep you on the bench and put Thatcher
in for the whole game. And until you can convince
me that you have taken baseball seriously
and that you will play hard all the time I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
going to keep him in the line up. Understand?
That’s all, Gould.”</p>

<p>That was Wednesday afternoon. Thursday
morning the team was posted for the next game,
which was the first out-of-town game of the
season and Jeff, as he entered the gym., that
afternoon, was surprised to be greeted by Wade
Grenville who had a broad smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Put her there, Old Hickey. You’ve made it
at last.”</p>

<p>“Made what? What’s happened? What do
you mean?” exclaimed Jeff, totally surprised.</p>

<p>“Why the regular team, you ninny. You are
slated to start the game at third Saturday over
at East Hampton. Look. There it is on the
board. See.”</p>

<p>Jeff looked at the bulletin and was surprised
to discover that in the batting order announced,
his name appeared in the place of Gould at third
base and Gould’s name was among the list of
substitutes.</p>

<p>“Well, by jingoes!” exclaimed Jeff jubilantly.
“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Happened, you old chump? Why, Coach Rice
has recognized your superior brand of baseball.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
That’s what. He’s tied a can to Gould which
most of the fellows think he should have done
long ago.”</p>

<p>“But Gould is good, Wade. There must be
something behind it all. I wonder—”</p>

<p>“Hello, Thatcher,” said Mr. Rice, coming up
behind the group of boys. “I’m going to give
Gould a rest. He seems a little stale so I’m
going to keep him on the bench to-morrow and
let you start the game. It all depends, of course,
on how you play, whether you finish it or not.
Play hard, my boy. Play it hard every step of
the way. Good luck.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Rice,” he said with enthusiasm.
Then as the coach passed on up the hall
he turned to Wade and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, it sure looks like a chance. Play
hard! Will I! Watch me! I’ve simply got to
make good. I want a chance to play in that
Lawrencetown game and win my P.”</p>

<small>FIRE!</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Custer School at East Hampton always put
a snappy and thoroughly aggressive ball team in
the field and Pennington always arranged to
crowd that game past the middle of its season, so
that there was no chance of the East Hampton
boys catching her with an under-developed team.</p>

<p>It was the only over-night trip on the Pennington
schedule and Coach Rice summoned the
team to appear at the gymnasium ready to take
the bus for the three-thirty afternoon train on
Friday for a five-hour ride to East Hampton.</p>

<p>It was a lively party that gathered with suitcases,
bats and gloves in the big gym. doorway
when Terry McCall, the bus driver, swung his big
yellow automobile stage down the drive and
backed up to receive the load of passengers. Of
course, the stage was not large enough to accommodate
the whole squad of fourteen boys without
crowding and there was a lively scramble for seats
and some horse play before they all managed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
wedge themselves in somehow and get adjusted
as the bus started snorting and lurching toward
the station.</p>

<p>They only just made the train. It stood puffing
impatiently in the station when Terry swung his
bus around with a flourish, and the boys streamed
out of the rear door and rushed madly for the
steps of the day coach. A train trip with a baseball
team is always a merry party as Jeff knew
for he had taken more than one as a member of
the New City Y. M. C. A. team the year before,
and he joined in the general fun and gentlemanly
boisterousness they indulged in as they took possession
of a day coach that held few occupants
besides themselves.</p>

<p>But the boisterousness gradually subsided as
hour after hour of wearying train travel rolled by,
and long before they reached East Hampton even
the noisiest of them had long since subsided, raising
only an occasional appeal for “eats.”</p>

<p>It was a hungry crew of boys who detrained
at East Hampton and made a rush for the Custer
School stage that stood backed into the graveled
approach waiting for them. And then the clamor
that they raised once they got inside was a noisy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
call for food, for it had been arranged that they
would take their evening meal, a little late to be
sure, in the dining hall of the school whose baseball
team they were to cross bats with the next
day.</p>

<p>That evening meal, however, turned out to be
a miniature banquet, for the managers of the
Custer School team had arranged to have the
boys of their squad eat with the Pennington
group and a really elaborate spread had been
arranged, which was concluded with speeches by
the team captains and the coaches and any of the
boys who could in any way provide entertainment
“stunts.”</p>

<p>The last “stunt” on the program was a really
clever dialogue between the Custer School captain,
Roy Milliken, and the team’s mascot,
“Spike,” a Boston bull dog of very likeable disposition.
Roy and Spike talked to each other in
“dog language.” Spike, apparently uninvited,
jumped on top of the table and stood in front of
Roy with one foot in a dish of olives. Roy pretended
to be horrified at the dog’s conduct and
proceeded to scold the animal in surly tones,
whereupon Spike began to talk back in barks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
growls until he seemed to work himself up to a
furious pitch. The little act had all the fellows
in stitches before it was concluded and the more
they laughed the more Spike seemed to enjoy
himself, barking and growling and raising a terrible
to-do until Roy affectionately swept him off
the table into his arms and gave him several
caressing pats on the head before putting him on
the floor where he proceeded to make the rounds
of the boys in the room, getting acquainted with
all the new fellows from Pennington.</p>

<p>Jeff loved dogs and when the animal got around
to him he picked him up in his arms and stroked
him and playfully pulled his ears, and the dog,
satisfied, snuggled down in his arms and stayed
there until the party broke up and the boys
began to leave for their rooms.</p>

<p>Arrangements had been made to have the Pennington
boys occupy extra rooms on the second
floor of one of the school buildings during their
stay and the entire squad was conducted across
the campus by the boys of Custer School with
whom they had become really chummy.</p>

<p>It was a big, old fashioned brick building, which
a half a century before had represented the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
school, class rooms, dormitories and master’s
quarters all being in the one structure. But the
school had grown since and the original building
was now one of the minor buildings of the school
group and given over entirely to rooms for most
of the members of the junior class.</p>

<p>As at Pennington, Jeff and Wade were roommates
and it was with a sigh of relief that they
found the room they were to occupy, turned on
the lights and threw themselves onto the two
couch beds that occupied opposite corners.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, I’m tired out,” said Jeff, beginning
to unlace his shoes.</p>

<p>“So am I. But we’ve had a bully time so far,
haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” said Jeff, suppressing a yawn as
he kicked off his trousers.</p>

<p>“Some nice fellows at this school. I like ’em
all. They are a bunch of huskies, too. Bet they
can play ball,” said Wade, crawling into the top
piece of his pajamas.</p>

<p>“We’ll know to-morrow, old son. Last in
turns out the light. I’m in,” yelled Jeff, tumbling
under the blankets and settling down on his
pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Wade snapped out the lights and followed
Jeff’s example, and in less than five minutes’
time husky snores began to make the room noisy.</p>

<p>A terrific clatter and clanging, yells and the
tramp of feet awakened Jeff. He sat bolt upright
in bed with a strange frightened feeling.
The terrific medley of sounds continued, and
above the racket he heard the shriek of a weird
whistle—a fire siren.</p>

<p>“Wade! Fire!” he exclaimed. Then he
added, “Great cats, the room is full of smoke.
It’s here. In this building. Wade! Wade!”</p>

<p>He bounced out of bed and went groping about
the room in the blackness trying to find the
electric light switch. He found it, snapped it on
but no light responded. The electric current had
failed.</p>

<p>“Jiminy crickets! No light! This is a mess!
Wade! Wade!”</p>

<p>“Wad’deyah wan’?” grumbled Wade sleepily.
Jeff heard him toss in his bed.</p>

<p>“Asleep in all this racket. Think of that,”
cried Jeff groping toward Wade’s corner of the
room. He found the bed and seizing his roommate
he shook him roughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“Lemme go. Git out, you chump,” grumbled
the still sleeping Wade kicking violently at Jeff.</p>

<p>“Come out of this, you chump,” yelled Jeff,
seizing him and dragging him from the bed to
the floor.</p>

<p>Wade fell out of bed with a thump and grumblingly
got to his feet.</p>

<p>“What’s all the infernal racket for, Jeff?
What’s— Say, I smell smoke. Jeff! What—!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do smell smoke, do you? It’s about
time. My golly, the house could burn down on
top of you and you’d never wake up. Get into
some clothes, quick. Remember where you put
’em? Lights are gone. Have to get something
on in the dark. Hurry. Room’s full of smoke,”
cried Jeff feeling about in places where he remembered
putting his clothes.</p>

<p>He found his coat, trousers and shoes, and he
made haste to get them all on, meanwhile feeling
about him for his suit case that contained his
baseball uniform. He found both his own and
Wade’s together and seizing them he cried to
Wade:</p>

<p>“Come on, for goodness’ sakes. We’re about
the last ones in the building I guess.” Coughing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
with the smoke that was getting into his lungs
as it swept through the room on the draught
created by the open window, Jeff crossed the
room, stumbling over various articles of clothing
that strewed the room. Gropingly he reached the
door and found the knob. A moment he waited
as he called:</p>

<p>“Wade, are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s get out of here quick,” said Wade,
bumping into him as he, too, groped for the door.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ve got to open the door and
close it quickly though, because there is no telling
what the draught might do in the way of bringing
the fire this way. Ready. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Jeff swung open the door and stepped out into
the hall and Wade crowded close behind him.
They slammed the door shut with a bang and
looked around.</p>

<p>A dull red glow, ugly and sinister, lighted the
long hall, and clouds of smoke, thick and black
and disconcerting, rolled past them. The noises
in the building had ceased but outside they could
hear shouts and calls, the tooting of fire engines’
whistles, the sound of breaking glass and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
swishing slosh and steady pounding of streams
of water.</p>

<p>“My goodness, the firemen have their hose lines
going already!” Jeff exclaimed to Wade. “We
must be the last ones in the building. All the
rest have cleared out long ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wonder if we are going to get out
before we get trapped,” said Wade with an unmistakable
note of concern in his voice.</p>

<p>“Sure, we will,” said Jeff with encouragement
that he did not entirely feel.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go. But which way? Listen!
What’s that noise? Sounds horrible!” exclaimed
Wade.</p>

<p>Jeff listened and cold chills crept up and down
his back. It was a steadily growing moaning
roar—the voice of the fire as it gathered in
volume and swept through the building. A sinister
crackling sound accompanied it, too, and
the dull glow through the smoke grew brighter.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, that’s some fire,” cried Jeff, becoming
slightly panic stricken as he realized how
close the fire was.</p>

<p>They started down the hallway together, making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
in the direction they felt the stairs must lay.
They hurried forward, through the smoke that
was thickening fast, protecting their eyes and
nose with their free arms while they lugged their
suit cases with the other.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, where are those stairs?” panted
Wade after a moment.</p>

<p>“Just ahead, I’m sure,” coughed Jeff.</p>

<p>“See any red exit lights? Might be a short way
to a fire escape,” said Wade.</p>

<p>“Nope, all the lights in the building are out,
evidently. I wonder if the fire started in the
power plant in the basement. Bet it did. Seems
to me—”</p>

<p><em>Crash! Bang!</em></p>

<p>Somewhere down stairs in the building came a
terrific, crashing explosion. Jeff and Wade staggered
under the concussion, and the whole building
shivered and shook for the fraction of a
second.</p>

<p>“Great cats, what was that?” cried Wade in
real terror.</p>

<p>“Must have been a boiler in the basement.
Come on, for goodness’ sakes, let’s get out of here
or we’ll be trapped sure,” cried Jeff, for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
losing control of himself and permitting
utter panic to sway him.</p>

<p>But an instant later he got a firmer grip on
himself and began to think more clearly than he
had at any time since he first discovered the fire.
Thicker, blacker smoke was rolling into the hallway
now and behind them Jeff could hear the
roar of flames more clearly. There was a peculiar
slope to the floor, too, which led Jeff to
believe that somewhere down the hall in the direction
from which they had come a hole had been
torn in the floor by the explosion. He realized
instantly that if this were true that hole would
create a new draught that would bring the flames
up onto their floor in terrific volume.</p>

<p>“Quick, Wade, we’ve got to move mighty fast
now or the whole building will be in flames. Wow,
there are the stairs. There, right ahead.”</p>

<p>Outlined through the smoke he could see the
iron railings of the stairway, and seizing Wade
by the arm he plunged toward them, Wade following
eagerly beside him.</p>

<p>They reached the top step and started down.
Great clouds of thick, black, gaseous smoke were
rolling upward toward them. They wondered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
vaguely whether they could struggle through
them and make the first floor and the open air
safely. Down stairs they could hear the flames
roaring louder than ever. They could hear the
hiss and spatter of hose lines, too, and the thunder
of the water pounding against the floor and side
walls.</p>

<p>“Must be a ripper of a fire. Listen to the water
they are pouring into it,” exclaimed Jeff, as they
started down the stair well.</p>

<p>Down they went step by step, working their way
cautiously, for by this time they could not see
where they were putting their feet and each had
a vague fear that at any moment they might step
off into space and go tumbling down the stair well,
so thick was the smoke. The draught was drawing
it up the stair well in ever increasing volume
and Jeff realized that ere long the flames would
follow. He knew that they must get clear of the
stairs as soon as possible and out of the building
before many minutes had passed or else they
would be doomed. Already they were both nearly
suffocated with the terrible nauseating smoke
fumes.</p>

<p>They continued on. Presently they reached a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
landing and a bend in the stairs; as they turned
they could behold part of the flame-swept lower
story of the building, and they gasped with horror
as they realized what a terrific fire was developing
there. It was a veritable furnace toward the
far end of the structure, and they realized too
that the flames were sweeping toward their end
of the building with terrifying speed. The structure
was surely doomed.</p>

<p>Presently they reached the floor, and found
themselves in a cooling draught that came evidently
from an opened door that led to the
campus. They could not see the doorway for the
smoke, but they knew in which direction safety
lay and they turned to go.</p>

<p>But as they did, a strangely pitiful sound came
to Jeff’s ears. It was the sharp whimper of a
dog in pain and fright. It came from somewhere
up the hall, and Jeff stopped and clutched Wade’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Listen. That must be Spike, their mascot.
Bet he’s caught in the building. We ought to
save him, Wade, if we can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but where is he? We ought to save ourselves,
too, Jeff. Come on, boy. Don’t take a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
chance. Safety is right ahead. Let’s get out
while we can.”</p>

<p>“You go, Wade. There, I heard him again.
He must be right here somewheres. You go on
out. I’ll follow directly. Just want to find that
pup. Go, Wade,” and Jeff shoved his roommate
ahead of him toward the door and turned back
to find Spike, whose whimper he could still faintly
hear.</p>

<p>Jeff was coughing and gagging with the smoke.
His lungs felt as if they would burst for want of
a breath of pure air and his head spun with the
blood that was pent up there, yet he took a half
dozen steps into the swirling smoke, calling at the
same time in hope that the dog would come to
him. Presently he found himself in the stair well
again, with the thick black cloud of smoke sweeping
past him. He turned and stepped aside to
avoid the terrible volume of the smoke borne upward
on the draught, and called again and again
hopefully. But as far as he could make out not
even an answering whimper was uttered.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s found his own way out. In that
case I guess I’d better be going myself,” said Jeff
aloud. Then turning, he started in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
he thought the doorway lay. A half dozen steps
forward he walked, groping blindly. But his
hands came in contact with nothing at all. Had
he gone in the right direction? No, the door was
this way to the left. He moved to his left a little
and tried again, only to presently fetch up against
a blank wall. This startled him. Perhaps the
door was here. He groped about again, panic
mounting swiftly. He stepped briskly forward
and the next moment he beheld with terror that
he was facing tongues of flames that were advancing
toward him.</p>

<p>Hastily he retreated. Then in his excitement
he tried to recall which was the front and which
was the back of the building, but for the life of
him he could not remember. Then suddenly the
truth dawned upon him. He was lost—lost in a
strange, flame-swept building. He had heard of
firemen being in similar circumstances, and he recalled
with horror the fate of some of them. More
than one had perished in this way. Such thoughts
were far from encouraging. What should he do?
Which way should he turn? The smoke was terrible—almost
unbearable now. He knew that if he
did not find the doorway soon he would be overcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
with the fumes and gases and then he knew
that he would perish.</p>

<p>The flames were drawing closer, too. Weird
lights flashed through the swirling smoke. It suddenly
seemed to Jeff that he was surrounded by
fire. And he knew that he could not stay in the
building much longer and not be overcome.
Blindly he started in another direction, hoping
again to find the stairs, or the doorway, or perchance
a window through which he could get one
single breath of fresh air. On he plunged until
suddenly he brought up with a bump against a
jutting corner in the wall. This did not help him
to locate himself. Indeed it confused him more.
Here were two passages, one straight in front of
him, the other leading off to his right. Which
way?</p>

<p>He started on again straight ahead, then suddenly
above the roar of the fast approaching
flames he heard one terror-stricken howl, followed
by a series of whines. Spike again, and he was
close at hand. This seemed to steady Jeff’s
nerves. He stopped, listened, then called:</p>

<p>“Here, Spike— Where are you— Good old
Spike. Come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Again he heard the whine almost at his feet, and
reaching down he groped about in the smoke.</p>

<p>His hand came in contact with the animal, huddled
beside a bookcase Jeff had not noticed before.
Jeff sensed something strange about the
animal and immediately began feeling for his
collar. Hooking his fingers into it, he drew Spike
out of his hiding place and lifted him into his
arms, dropping his suit case with its contents of
precious baseball paraphernalia which until now
he had not realized he had been carrying through
all his peril. In the smoke he made a hasty examination
of the dog. He was injured. Something
had fallen on him, perhaps as a result of the
explosion. One side was badly cut and bruised
and his two front legs hung limp and helpless.</p>

<p>“Crackey, Spike, you sure got it rough, didn’t
you?” said Jeff soothingly. “How did it happen
that the fellows went off and left you. Or did
you get lost and—and—say, you <em>are</em> crippled,
aren’t you? You can’t get out of here alive alone,
that’s sure. I don’t know whether I’m going to
get out myself. But we’ll try, old fellow, we’ll
try.”</p>

<p>He snuggled the dog close to his chest and then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
still protecting his eyes and nose with his crooked
arm, he staggered on down the passageway again,
hoping that somehow, by the merest chance, the
merest good luck, he would find an exit, or perhaps
come in contact with some of the firemen who
must be fighting the flames inside the building.
He knew that he must find relief soon or—</p>

<p>He tripped. Something smooth and round was
under his feet. It was a line of hose! Instantly
stories he had read and heard told of how firemen
had saved themselves under similar circumstances
came to his mind. The hose line led somewhere.
It was a guide to the way out of the building.
Many a fireman, by following a hose line, had
found open air, and relief from smoke punishment.
They usually followed it on their knees
with their faces close to the cold, pulsating rubber,
for the water throbbing through the line generated
a layer of cold, sweet, fresh air about the
hose which could be breathed.</p>

<p>Jeff dropped to his knees and holding his nose
on one side of the hose and Spike’s on the other
he struggled forward, following the line. On he
crawled. His knees and elbows were soon skinned
and filled with splinters. But he knew that if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
kept on he would sooner or later find a way out.
It was hard going and even with his nose to the
hose line he could not get enough clear air to
overcome the gases he had swallowed. He was
growing weaker. He only hoped that he had
strength enough to keep up a little longer. He
exerted every ounce of will power he possessed
and fought stubbornly. Then suddenly, to make
the situation more horrible than ever, the hose
line began to move. Some one was pulling away
from him his only guide to safety. Jeff in desperation
clutched at the smooth black rubber tube
madly! Slowly it drew away from him! In desperation
he half struggled to his feet and shouted
frantically! And the next instant he beheld four
vague shapes looming out of the smoke and coming
toward him. They were firemen. They had
come to his rescue.</p>

<p>The firemen half led and half carried Jeff, semi-conscious
and still clutching Spike, to the open
air and safety. A great shout went up from the
crowd outside when they saw them appear in the
doorway of the building and make their way
through swirling smoke clouds to the campus.</p>

<p>Eager hands seized Jeff and carried him out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the danger zone; then with a crowd of Custer and
Pennington boys gathered around, Jeff was laid
on the grass, and one of the school physicians
began to work over him.</p>

<p>“I’m—all—right— Don’t fuss—over—,” said
Jeff, after a moment. “Just—give—me—a—drink—of—water.”</p>

<p>The drink was provided and so were restoratives,
but the clear, fresh, invigorating air was
the best restorative of all, and soon Jeff was able
to sit up and grin sheepishly.</p>

<p>At the sight of his smile Wade Grenville set up
a wild shout which developed into a cheer that
echoed across the whole campus.</p>

<p>“Where’s Spike?” asked Jeff, when the shouts
had subsided.</p>

<p>Roy Milliken crowded forward then and shook
Jeff’s hand. “Thanks, old fellow,” he said
huskily to Jeff. “Spike and I got separated on
our way out and I guess he must have thought I
was lost and went back to find me. Poor beast
got smashed up. A couple of the fellows took him
over to the basement of the gym. and made him
comfortable. Thanks again, old man; it was a
mighty gritty thing to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Shucks, don’t mention it. I’m going over to
the gym. myself and have a plunge.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, go ahead. It will make you feel a
heap better. And I’ll get trainer Al Meyers to
give you a good alcohol rubdown afterward. Then
you’ll be fit to play baseball this afternoon; that
is, if there is to be a game.”</p>

<small>THIRD BASE THATCHER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The question of whether there was to be a game
or not was long debated that morning by the
Custer School authorities. The fire had created
no end of excitement at the school and in the
village. And when the news of the burning of
the fine old school building got abroad by means
of the newspaper telegraph system anxious parents
from all corners of the country began to telephone
and telegraph concerning the safety of their
boys.</p>

<p>It was long after daylight before the firemen got
control of the fire and finally put it out, and
when the last of them had gone back to their
stations the gaunt, smoking ruins of one wing of
the building stood out against the green spring
verdure of the campus, stark and grimly fire-blackened.</p>

<p>There was a tremendous feeling of unrest
among the students, too, for all of them had been
aroused from their beds at an early hour that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
morning and of course none of them had returned
to catch up on their sleep. Under such conditions
the school authorities were not certain whether
to attempt to play the scheduled baseball game or
not.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock that morning a conference
was called in the administration building by Headmaster
Dr. Shwagert, of Custer School. Coach
Rice and Mr. Clarkson, and the Pennington captain,
Tad Sloan, were included, with the two
coaches of the Custer School team, Roy Milliken,
and several of the school department heads. And
at this conference the advisability of playing the
game was carefully talked over. The conclusion
was, however, that the students needed something
to take their minds off the catastrophe of the
night and announcement was made that the game
would go on.</p>

<p>The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm
by the students and the players of both teams
as well, for all of the boys were as eager for the
contest as they had been before the fire. To be
sure, most of the Pennington boys, including Jeff,
had lost their baseball togs and some of their
equipment in the flames, but an hour’s rummaging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
in the gymnasium of the Custer School brought
to light enough available equipment and cast-off
uniforms to fit out the players who had lost their
things, and by noon time everything was ready
for the contest.</p>

<p>The game was arranged for two-thirty, as it had
been originally scheduled, and of course the entire
student body of the East Hampton school turned
out and lined the field. Even the mascot, Spike,
was brought out from his resting place in the
basement of the gym. and taken to the Custer
School’s bench, where, swathed in bandages, he
was propped up on several gay pillows requisitioned
from some of the boys’ rooms, and despite
his suffering he evidently enjoyed the attentions
showed to him, because he made a valiant effort
to wag his stump of a tail every time any of the
boys approached him. And he seemed especially
grateful to Jeff, for when the third baseman went
over to give him an affectionate pat the dog
licked his hand by way of thanking him for his
rescue.</p>

<p>But as a contest the game was far from a success.
Indeed it was a very poor exhibition of
baseball on the part of both teams, for when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
boys got out on the field they realized soon enough
that the excitement, keyed-up nerves, and loss of
sleep had left them in far from fit condition to do
their best as athletes.</p>

<p>Coach Rice approached Jeff just before the
game was called and taking him aside spoke to him
in a very fatherly fashion.</p>

<p>“Look here, Thatcher, I planned to start you
at third to-day, as I told you. But you had a
rather trying experience last night which must
have taken a hard toll of your physical resources.
I am inclined to keep you on the bench to-day and
let Gould play. You may need a rest more than
you need the physical exertion of playing the
game. How do you feel, boy?”</p>

<p>Jeff’s disappointment was evident instantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, look here, coach,” he said eagerly,
“there’s nothing the matter with me at all.
Really there isn’t. I feel as fit as a fiddle. That
swim and rub down I had just about set me up.
And I got a good nap over in the gym., too. I’m
just crazy to play.”</p>

<p>The coach was silent for a moment while he
studied the boy. Then he smiled and said:</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll let you go in. But promise me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
when you feel that the exertion is too much for
you you will let me know. I don’t want to be
responsible for having you break down when you
get back to school and cause you to have a session
in the infirmary, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t fear, coach. I’m all right. Just let
me go in.”</p>

<p>The coach gave Jeff his way, but the new third
baseman soon realized that Mr. Rice knew a lot
more about the physical capabilities of boys than
he did. He was far from being at the top of his
game and his playing was decidedly ragged. But
at that he seemed to have himself better in hand
than most of the other players, for they were all
just as ragged as he was and some of them a great
deal more so. About the only one who seemed to
have his feet on the ground at all was sturdy little
Tad Sloan, the catcher and captain. He played
a good, heady baseball game, and he tried
valiantly to instill his own confidence into the
rest, but with little success.</p>

<p>The game opened up a veritable “swat fest,”
to quote the baseball writers. The Custer School
pitcher, Ray Strong, was in bad shape during the
first three innings and the visitors found him for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
several bunches of clean hits ranging from sizzling
singles, to a long three-base drive by Dutch
Hecht that brought in two runs.</p>

<p>But big George Dixon seemed to be no better off
than the Custer School man, for he was “as wild
as a tom cat,” as Coach Rice expressed it. He
passed the first and second man up and served a
wide out to the next Custer batter, who promptly
landed on it for a smash into right field that
brought both runners home and put him in a position
to score on the next hit, which was not long
in coming. Indeed, the Custer School players
buried Dixon under an avalanche of hits in the
first and second innings and he finally appealed to
Coach Rice to take him out until he could steady
down. Honey Wiggins went in after that and
seemed to be just the man to step into the breach,
for he steadied down and actually struck out two
of the opposing players for the first two strike
outs of the game.</p>

<p>They took out Ray Long, too, in the third and
put in a young husky with terrific speed and fine
control, but very little versatility in pitching anything
but straight balls. He was good, however,
and he seemed to be working on something more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
than pure nerve which had been Long’s case for
the first three innings.</p>

<p>Each side had scored heavily in the opening
innings, with the advantage going to the Custer
School team. The tally stood 8 to 6 at the beginning
of the fourth inning. But both teams showed
signs of steadying down, however, and with the
advent of new pitchers the hitting suddenly let
down. Indeed, Honey Wiggins held the Custer
team to two hits in the succeeding three innings
and neither of them amounted to more than getting
a man on base.</p>

<p>The new Custer pitcher also kept the hits scattered
until the beginning of the seventh, when
big Lafe Gammage, the second man up, slammed
a likely bingle between short and third, and
Mickey Daily beat out a pretty bunt and advanced
Lafe to second. There were two on and one out.
Buck Hart was up next and Buck was due for a
hit.</p>

<p>The speed artist on the Custer mound looked
the situation over carefully and realized that he
was in a hole. He tried to coax Buck to swing at
an offering a trifle wide that zipped over with the
speed of a cannon ball, but Buck refused. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
tried another one a little low and Buck only smiled.
There were two balls on him and no strikes.</p>

<p>The Custer pitcher calculated that it was time
now to put over a strike, figuring that Buck would
pass it just on a chance that it might be called a
ball, so he whipped over one that fairly sizzled
as it cut the inside corner of the plate. Buck saw
it was a likely ball, and he made a vicious stab at
it and connected. It went crashing toward the
first baseman, who was playing close to his bag,
and it looked for a moment as if Buck had batted
into a double play.</p>

<p>It was a terrifically hot ball that the first
baseman tried to field, but he fumbled it, the
sphere shooting at a tangent toward second base.
Wildly he scrambled for it, while the pitcher raced
to cover first. Meanwhile, Lafe had gone down to
third and Mickey Daily was racing to second.
The chances for a double play had gone glimmering
with that error and it was evident that it was
going to be a hard job to even catch Buck at first.
Lafe overran third, and watching the scrambling
first baseman started for home, Gleason, on the
coaching line, gave him the signal and he sprinted
for the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>By that time the first baseman had fielded the
ball, and seeing a runner streaking for the plate
he whipped the horsehide down to the catcher.
But the throw was low, and as the catcher tried
to dig the sphere out of the dust Lafe slid over with
long arms and legs flying, and the umpire called
him safe.</p>

<p>That left Daily on second and Buck Hart
on first and Jeff Thatcher was the next man
up.</p>

<p>Jeff had one hit to his credit so far. He decided
that he wanted another to bring Daily in
and tie the score. And he got it. <a href="#i_frontis">He leaned on
the very first ball pitched</a> and smashed it over the
second baseman’s head for a fine clean single, and
meanwhile Daily, who was working on a long lead
off the base, scored standing up, while Buck Hart
went to third. The score was evened up, with a
man on first and a man on third and only one out.
It looked as if Pennington could sew up the game
right there,—it looked that way but it did not work
out that way. Instead, Dave Gleason, the next
man up, batted into a double play. Jeff was
caught at second by a snappy play by the Custer
short stop, and Dave Gleason was thrown out with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
a yard or two to spare at first and the side was
retired.</p>

<p>With the score tied the Custer team came up to
the bat for the last half of the seventh full of determination.
And they started to make good with
the first player, who found Honey Wiggins for a
hit just out of reach of the shortstop.</p>

<p>The next player up was one of the best batters
on the Custer team and Jeff had been watching
him the entire game. As he picked up his stick,
Jeff noticed that the Custer coach passed him a
signal. He could not interpret it but he made a
wild guess at it. The man at the bat was a
slugger. A wise coach, under the present circumstances,
with all of the players looking for a slashing
hit, would doubtless signal the batter to bunt
and try and beat it out while the man on first went
down to second. Jeff realized that there were a
dozen chances to one that he had guessed wrong;
but playing for a lucky break, and instead of backing
out when the slugger came to bat, he set himself
for a sprint in toward the plate.</p>

<p>He started a moment after the ball left Honey
Wiggins’ hand, and sprinted toward the batter.
And he had guessed right. The Custer slugger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
shorted his bat and bunted a soft rolling bunt that
bounded directly toward the oncoming Jeff. On
the run Jeff scooped it up, snapped it down to first,
and Lafe Gammage, on his toes, relayed it to second
for a double play. The Pennington crowd
went wild, and there were cheers for Jeff even
from the Custer School contingent, for he had displayed
a brand of snappy baseball in a game that
had been as ragged as could be, which, perhaps,
was one reason why his play stood out so conspicuously.
But regardless of that fact the cheers
sounded good to him, and especially good came the
shout from right field, where Wade Grenville
yelled:</p>

<p>“That’s baseball, old Frog.”</p>

<p>With two out it looked as if the inning would
be closed with the next man up, and Honey Wiggins
pitched to him, determined to make him fan.
But Honey did not know how really dangerous
this batter was or he would have been more discreet.
The third ball that was served to him evidently
looked to be just what he wanted, for he
swung with all his might. A startling crash resulted,
and the horsehide went soaring up and up
and out, far over Jeff Thatcher’s head and on into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
left field. Dutch Hecht was running back as fast
as his short legs could carry him, which was
mighty fast at times. But in this instance Dutch
and his legs were not equal to the occasion, for
when the ball hit the ground Dutch was still running
toward the spot it dropped, and when he
finally recovered it and threw it back to Jeff, a wild
shout went up from the stands, for the runner had
crossed the plate for a home run, and, as it proved,
the winning run of the game, for in the remaining
two innings neither Custer nor Pennington were
able to score again, and the final tally was 9 to 8
in favor of the home team.</p>

<p>But despite the loss of the game Jeff did not
feel as despondent as might have been the case,
for on their way back to the Custer gymnasium,
Coach Rice came over to his side and walked with
him a little way.</p>

<p>“That was heady baseball you played in the
seventh inning. I like to see a man use his head
that way. Of course you got a lucky break, too,
but I like to see a man on his toes and ready to
take advantage of lucky breaks just as you did.
I guess we’ll have to give you the regular job at
third base, Thatcher.”</p>

<p>Spring swung swiftly onward toward June and
the finals,—the examinations toward which every
fellow in the school had been looking forward
since mid-year with a certain amount of worry
and not a few misgivings. And one after another
the games on the baseball schedule were becoming
history as each Saturday and Wednesday slipped
by. Each game was becoming harder now, for the
Pennington team was reaching the stiffest part
of its schedule. But the team was making a fine
record in spite of the strong combinations that the
players were pitted against. Bedford Hall was
well trounced in a sizzling game that brought out
all sorts of fine baseball; Carlton Hill Prep was
defeated by a narrow margin; Brunswick, the
hard-hitting champions of Sussex County Scholastic
League, were beaten in a ten-inning game,
and even the Princeton Freshmen were humbled
after an extra-inning session that reached a dramatic
climax when Wade Grenville poled out a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
home run right after a smashing double by Buck
Hart. Binghamton High, Hanover Prep and the
Crescent Club of Dover were humbled successively,
and the Pennington team seemed to be moving
along irresistibly toward a complete clean-up of
its schedule, when quite suddenly it received a
setback that probably did the team more good
than several more victories.</p>

<p>The Washington-Childs School team came to
Pennington. It was a little school and actually
a little team. The nine was composed of boys
none of whom was older than seventeen, and many
of them looked to be about fifteen. They were all
short, stocky, sturdy players except the pitcher,
who was the giant of the squad, a long, rangy
country boy with hands as big as fielders’ mitts;
at least they looked that big as they dangled at
the ends of his grotesquely long lean arms. His
feet were big and his face was big and round and
good-natured and covered with freckles that
ranged from the size of pinheads to some the size
of a dime. He looked more like a country clown
than a baseball player, and the Pennington boys
looked at him and smiled. Here, they thought,
was a break in their stiff schedule. This would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
be a romp; a veritable walkaway, and unfortunately
they went onto the field with that attitude
of mind.</p>

<p>Their supreme confidence was elevated to the
heights of absolute conceit, after the first inning,
for the visiting team was set down hitless while
they poled out three safe drives off of the freckle-faced
pitcher’s delivery which netted them a run.
It certainly looked easy.</p>

<p>But the confident Penningtons soon discovered
that things are not always the way they look from
first appearances. Somehow, it really looked as
if it were an accident, one of the Washington
players landed on George Dixon’s delivery for a
two-bagger in the second inning and the next man
up placed a neat sacrifice hit between first and
second and advanced the runner to third. Then
in business-like fashion the next player up, a lad
not a day older than fifteen, slammed a single just
out of reach of Mickey Daily, and the man on
third romped home. The inning ended with the
next man up, but the score was tied.</p>

<p>The Pennington players came in, slightly puzzled
to understand just how it all happened.
They were still quite certain that it had all been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
an accident and they decided to alter the score
right there in the last of the second and take a
lead that would just about discourage the visiting
team.</p>

<p>But accidents seemed to continue to happen.
Jed Stafford, always a reliable hitter, was the
first man up, and the good-natured face full of
freckles in the pitcher’s box proceeded to bend
some mystifying curves over the plate that Jed
could only marvel at but could not possibly find
with the end of his bat. It took four pitched balls
to send Jed back to the bench, as puzzled as ever.</p>

<p>“Jiminy, that boy has something on the ball,
believe me,” he assured Coach Rice.</p>

<p>“Hum, I noticed you didn’t have anything on
the end of your bat,” said the coach sarcastically;
“you fanned like a novice. I guess when you kids
get through you’ll know you’ve been up against
a pitcher. He’s just about the best man to step
in that pitcher box this season or I miss my
guess.”</p>

<p>The coach was right. He of the long arms and
the freckles made the heavy hitting Dutch Hecht,
the next man up, look like an amateur. He gave
him three balls, at which Hecht refused to strike,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
and then he proceeded to bend three more over
the plate in such fashion that Dutch simply grunted
as he swung at the last.</p>

<p>About that time the opposing catcher began to
liven up, too, and talk a little. And the line of
baseball “guff” he handed out completely took the
wind out of the next batter’s sails, and he fanned,
too. Pennington had gone down one, two, three,—three
successive strike outs, an “accident” that
had not happened to the team all season.</p>

<p>To be sure, the fellows took a brace right there.
Their conceit had been nicely taken down and they
decided that the only way they could beat the
combination they were facing was to take them
seriously and play their hardest. They did. But
somehow their hardest did not seem to amount to
much. The visiting players, with all the confidence
in the world, waded right into George
Dixon and spattered hits around the diamond and
outfield something scandalous, and while the Pennington
players did their best to keep these hits
from developing into runs, their best was none
too good and five runs did slip through.</p>

<p>As for the opposing pitcher, he of the freckles,
long arms and a smile, there seemed to be nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
in the way of curves that he could not deliver to
perfection when he had to. He had slow balls
and swift balls, too, floaters and a mystifying
assortment of almost everything in the pitching
line, and the result was he made the Pennington
players look like a lot of sand-lot kids. Indeed
when the dust finally settled and the game was
neatly folded away in the official score book, the
Pennington players discovered that the Washington
pitcher had left a humiliating record behind
him. He struck out ten men, and allowed six hits
from which they managed to get one run, and that
in the first inning. That was all. They had been
defeated to the tune of 5 to 1. The worst beating
they had received during the entire season so far.</p>

<p>“Crackey,” said Wade Grenville to Jeff, in the
locker room after the game, “I never faced anything
like that for pitching. He’s going to be one
of the best pitchers in the country when he gets
three years more on his shoulders. There didn’t
seem to be a thing he couldn’t make the ball
do.”</p>

<p>“It surely was air-tight pitching. I begin to
think we don’t know a thing about the game the
way they trimmed us. Some pitching, I’ll say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“He was a wiz. I’d almost believe he was a
ringer,—a semi-pro. or something like that,” said
Buck Hart disconsolately, as he pulled off one
cleated shoe and threw it into his locker.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s no ringer,” said Coach Rice, who
came up in time to hear Buck’s remark. “He’s
an honest-to-goodness student at Washington-Childs
and he sure had you fellows looking like a
lot of posts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world,” said big George Dixon;
“I’ll tell ’em, too, that he’s no ringer, either. I
know who he is. He’s Badger Clark, a fellow
from Iowa; rich ranchman’s son; and I’ve heard
that Yale and Harvard and Princeton are all trying
to make him believe that he’ll make the mistake
of his life if he doesn’t register at their particular
institution next year.”</p>

<p>“Well, whoever gets him will be mighty fortunate,”
said Coach Rice.</p>

<p>But that defeat, coming as it did in the tightest
and hardest part of the Pennington schedule,
really helped the fellows, for whatever conceit
and overconfidence had been accumulating as a
result of their succession of victories disappeared
over night. They suddenly realized that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
were just a baseball team and not a lot of champions,
and they settled down to afternoon practice
with more of a feeling that practice was necessary
than they had had heretofore.</p>

<p>The team had not undergone any radical
changes during the season. Rabbit Warren, Cas
Gorham and Brownie Davis, the three first string
substitutes, were given a number of chances to
fill in for regulars who were taken out for some
reason or another, and Gould, who still reported
for each game in uniform, was given an occasional
opportunity to fill in for Thatcher, Buck Hart or
Mickey Daily; but he was listed as being among
the substitutes and Thatcher became the permanent
third baseman of the team, clinching his hold
on the position by playing a steady and dependable
game as he well knew how to play, giving his
best to the team and occasionally flashing bits of
brilliant baseball that pleased the coach and his
assistant and made the rest of the players proud
of him. He was Third Base Thatcher and living
up to his name.</p>

<p>But Gould hung on despite the discouragement
of losing his job as a regular. He hung on for
much the same reason that Jeff had been eager<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
to become a fixture on the team. Gould was a
Sophomore, and as a Freshman the preceding year
he had been a substitute third baseman, but he had
not been given the privilege of playing in the
Lawrencetown game and thereby winning his letters,—winning
the privilege of wearing a buff
“P” on cap and blue jersey. He wanted that
honor. He wanted to win his letters and that
was the one reason why he stuck to the squad as
a substitute, hoping, of course, that chance, or
luck, or something would make it possible for him
to play in the Lawrencetown game long enough
to be entitled to that privilege.</p>

<p>The school ruling was that to win a letter for
baseball a player had to play in seven scheduled
games during one season, but one of those seven
games had to be the game with Lawrencetown.
Gould had taken part in more than seven games
and so had Jeff, but it was necessary for both of
them to play in the Lawrencetown game before
they could be awarded the honor they strove for.
So Gould clung on, although it was evident that
Thatcher had made the regular position at third,
hoping no doubt that something would happen, or
that Coach Rice would relent at the last moment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
as coaches frequently do, and shove him into the
game just so that he could earn his letter.</p>

<p>But as the schedule was played it began to look
as if there was small opportunity for Gould to
get the chance he was looking for. Coach Rice
did not seem to consider him with any more favor
than he had immediately after the Fayville High
School game. He made Gould earn every opportunity
to play at all, and he demanded every bit
as much energy and loyalty and attention to practice
as he did from the regular players.</p>

<p>Gould was not of the temperament to accept a
situation of this sort with good grace. The
humiliation he had suffered at being put among
the substitutes had been a bitter pill for him to
swallow, but to be continued as a second-string
man while he watched Thatcher make good in his
old job hurt his natural conceit and pride more
than he was willing to admit even to himself.</p>

<p>He went about with a perpetual grouch, and he
did far less bragging than he had done before.
He became very unpopular in his class, too, because
of the disposition he developed, and there
were few of his former friends who appeared to
care very much about him. Yet in spite of it all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
one boy clung to him as closely as ever and seemed
to admire him as much as he had in former days.
That was Birdie Pell. It seemed very strange to
most of the fellows that this should be so. Jeff,
for one, could not understand why the little
Sophomore should still insist on chumming with
Gould, who to appearances had developed into a
thoroughly unpleasant person. Others tried to
understand it, too, and failing, classed Birdie Pell
in the same category as Gould, and as a result had
very little to do with him. Yet this seemed to
make but very little difference to Pell, for he went
blithely on his way of palling with Gould, until
they became a thoroughly lonesome couple, finding
their own pleasures and developing their own
interests.</p>

<p>Jeff devoted a great deal of thought to this
strange companionship and tried to analyze the
reason for it. But in the end he had to give it
up as a problem too deep for him to solve. For
some reason he liked Birdie in spite of his associations
and some unpleasant faults of personality.
And Pell seemed to think well of him, for
even though Gould hated Jeff with a hate that was
almost sinister Birdie was always pleasant to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Thatcher even in Gould’s company. When they
passed Thatcher on the campus, though Gould
glowered and looked ugly, Birdie always smiled
and had a cheery word, and in the halls of the
school buildings Pell frequently stopped to chat
just a moment with Thatcher while classes were
changing.</p>

<p>As the spring term drew on toward June and
the time for final examinations, Jeff found that
he had a lot more to think about than baseball.
School work was piling up fast and getting stiffer
and stiffer for the entire year was being reviewed
and new work was being crowded in as well. With
the examinations looming ahead, Jeff, and most of
the other fellows, were cramming hard, burning
the midnight oil, so to speak, whenever they could
find opportunity.</p>

<p>Especially were the baseball men studying hard,
for there was a scholastic rule at Pennington that
no boy could play on any of the athletic teams
representing the school unless his school standing
was all that it should be.</p>

<p>The final examinations were scheduled for the
eighth of June and the last and crucial game of
the season, the Lawrencetown game, was scheduled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
for the following Saturday, which was the
fifteenth of June, and all of the players realized
that to be eligible for the big game of the season
they would all have to pass the examinations with
flying colors.</p>

<p>And besides this highly important reason Jeff
had still another reason for wanting to make a
good showing in his studies. The other reason
was Mr. Davidson, the President of the Third
National Bank, who was making it possible for
Jeff to remain at Pennington. During the school
term Jeff had written repeatedly to his benefactor
just by way of keeping in touch with him
and informing him of his school standing, and
the few letters that he had received in answer to
his messages were always hearty, encouraging and
very cheerful. Indeed Mr. Davidson maintained
what almost amounted to a fatherly interest in
Jeff, and especially was he interested in his baseball
career.</p>

<p>Several times he had motored over to Pennington
of a Saturday afternoon and watched the team
play, and he was always very careful to seek out
Jeff and have a cheerful chat with him before the
boy went back to the locker room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>Realizing this interest in him, Jeff studied hard
as the final examinations approached. Indeed he
soon became a veritable “bone,” to quote Wade
Grenville, who frequently had to roar to Jeff to
turn out the light and come to bed. In truth
Jeff became so serious over his studies that he
often carried one text book or another about with
him, snatching odd moments to study. Especially
did he carry around his Cæsar, for he realized that
he was weaker in his Latin than in any other
study. And strange to relate it was this conscientious
habit that brought Jeff Thatcher no
end of trouble and resulted in a situation that
threatened again to wreck his whole career at
Pennington.</p>

<p>Jeff carried his Cæsar in his outside jacket
pocket most of the time, and one day early in
June, having a half hour to spare before climbing
into his uniform for practice he sat in the sun on
the gym. steps and thumbed over his translations,
committing a particularly hard passage to memory.
He worked at it right up until the time the
other members of the squad began to arrive in the
gym., then, as he thought, he slipped the book into
his pocket and went down stairs to the locker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
room to undress and put on his baseball uniform,
leaving his school clothes in his locker, which
unfortunately was not all that its name implied,
for it did not always lock with safety.</p>

<p>He spent about three hours on the field with
the rest of the squad, and then, returning late to
the gym., he dressed and started for his room.
Arriving there, he felt for his Cæsar and discovered
that it was not in the pocket in which he felt
certain he had slipped it. He started to trace
back in his memory to see if he could recall just
when he had used the book last and remembered
that he had been sitting on the gym. steps studying
for some time before he went to the locker
room. He wondered whether he could have left
the book lying on the steps, and to make certain
he retraced his steps to the gym. and began to
look around in the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson came out of the gym. door while
he was looking and, seeing him, asked if he were
looking for a book.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. My Cæsar, sir. I must have left it
here, though I could have sworn I put it in my
pocket.”</p>

<p>“I saw a junior school boy pick up a book on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
steps here not an hour ago. I was going into the
gym. as he was coming out, and I suggested that
he take it over to the office. I guess you’ll find it
there,” said the assistant coach as he passed on.</p>

<p>Jeff hurried over to the office only to discover
that it was six o’clock and the door was locked.
Dr. Livingston and his assistants had evidently
left the building for the day.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll get it in the morning. I’ve got
that bloomin’ translation almost pat now, anyhow,
so I won’t worry. I’ll try and bone up on
algebra to-night. I’ll pick up the book first thing
in the morning,” he assured himself, as he hurried
off to his room to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>But he had no time to go to the office before
breakfast next morning, and he lingered so long
in the dining room that he came very near being
late for chapel, and consequently had no time to
retrieve his lost book before the regular morning
exercises.</p>

<p>However, he had the missing text book on his
mind, and therefore he was not disturbed when
Dr. Livingston, while making announcements
from the platform, asked that he report in the
office before the first period. Jeff concluded that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
the Headmaster wanted to give him his book, and,
perhaps a bit of a scolding for carelessness.</p>

<p>After chapel Jeff walked over to the office and,
after knocking, entered. Dr. Livingston was evidently
plunged in deep thought. When he looked
up, at Jeff’s entrance, Thatcher noticed that there
was a pained and discouraged expression on his
face. He looked at Jeff unsmilingly as the boy
crossed the office and stood beside his desk, and
Jeff was puzzled and a little worried by his expression.</p>

<p>On the Headmaster’s desk Jeff noticed his
Cæsar. He smiled then and reached for it.</p>

<p>“I guess I was a little careless, Dr. Livingston,
I must have left it on the gym. steps.”</p>

<p>“Is that where you left it, Thatcher?” asked
the Headmaster, almost wearily, as he laid his
hand on the book to prevent Jeff from picking
it up.</p>

<p>“Why, I must have. That’s where it was found,
wasn’t it, sir?” asked Jeff in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is where it was found. I—I—rather
hoped—” The Headmaster stopped talking. It
was evident to Jeff that there was something unpleasant
on his mind,—something that discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
him,—made him feel that all his efforts to
train his boys had gone for naught. Jeff thought
that his carelessness at leaving the book around
could not be responsible for all of the Master’s
apparent emotion and he wondered what on earth
could have happened. He was presently to know.</p>

<p>“Thatcher,” said Dr. Livingston, clearing his
throat and looking at Jeff searchingly, “a really
terrible thing has happened,—a terrible crime has
been committed here in school and circumstances
point to you as the criminal!”</p>

<p>The last was snapped out with such startling
emphasis that Jeff grew weak and nervous. He
felt as if his stomach had suddenly melted away,
and that he was nothing but head and legs with
no connection between.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not find voice to speak.
When he did his voice was nervous and apprehensive.</p>

<p>“But—but—Dr. Livingston, I don’t understand.
I—er—what is it?”</p>

<p>“Room 44 has evidently been entered, for an
examination paper has disappeared,” snapped out
the Headmaster, watching Jeff’s face carefully
to see the effect of his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>Jeff was stunned. Of all offenses at Pennington
this was certainly the most serious. To enter
Room 44 at any time and under any circumstances
was the most dishonorable thing that a student
could do. This was the room in which the examination
papers were prepared and kept. All
of the students were aware of this fact and honor
bound to respect the restrictions that none was to
enter that room under any conditions. Some one
in school had violated this trust and suspicion
pointed to him!</p>

<p>“How—why—this is terrible, Dr. Livingston.
But—but why do you suspect me, sir?” asked
Jeff.</p>

<p>For answer Dr. Livingston took his hand from
the book before him and lifted the cover. Inside
the fly leaf, neatly folded, Jeff saw a sheet of
light green paper which he recognized only too
well as the form in which the examinations in
Latin were always printed at Pennington.</p>

<p>“Your book was found, Thatcher, with this in
it,” said Dr. Livingston wearily.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<small>VOICES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jeff staggered back as if he had been struck a
blow in the face. Was this treachery? The evidence
was certainly accusing.</p>

<p>But suddenly his nervousness passed and just
anger and resentment took its place. His face
became red and he could feel his collar grow too
tight for him.</p>

<p>“Of all the rotten, crooked tricks, this is the
worst I have ever heard of, sir,” he exclaimed.
“Now I know why that book was not in my
pocket where I put it and where I knew it should
be. Whoever stole the examination papers also
stole my book from my pocket and put one of the
papers in it. Then he left the book where it
would be found and turned in at the office, so you
could find this evidence. That is just about the
meanest trick a fellow could do.”</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston looked at him searchingly for
several seconds and it seemed to Jeff as if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
cloud that had settled over the Headmaster
lifted just a little.</p>

<p>“Thatcher, did you enter Room 44?” he said
sternly and in a manner that demanded a truthful
answer.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have never been in the room, sir,”
said Jeff drawing himself up erect and looking
the Master squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you steal the examination papers that
are missing?” continued Dr. Livingston.</p>

<p>“I did not. I have never before seen that
paper that you just showed me folded in my
book.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about this disagreeable
situation at all,” demanded Dr. Livingston,
finally.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than you have told me right
here, sir!” replied Jeff.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston was silent for several seconds.
Again he spoke:</p>

<p>“Thatcher, I believe you. But here is mighty
unpleasant circumstantial evidence that I must
accept until a better case can be made out for
your defense or damnation. Until then you are
barred from taking the final examination. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
course, you are set down from the baseball team
and any other athletic team in school. You must
keep within bounds at all times and you must be
in your room at eight o’clock every evening. I’m
very sorry, Thatcher, but you realize the seriousness
of the situation. I am going to conduct an
immediate investigation and will clear this thing
up as soon as possible and”—the Headmaster
stood up and put his hand on Jeff’s shoulder—“Thatcher,
I hope you are telling the truth and
that you can prove your statements, for, my boy,
I like you a great deal and it would hurt me more
than you can believe to know that you were party
to any dishonorable acts. When I saw your
name in this book here it made me feel sick at
heart, my boy. Go, now, and we will try to work
this out happily for you, anyway.”</p>

<p>Jeff could not choke back a lump that came
into his throat as the kindly Headmaster spoke
to him, and in spite of his best efforts tears
mounted to his eyes and spilled over onto his
cheek. He had never had the benefit of paternal
affection and the fatherly attitude of the venerable
Dr. Livingston reached a strangely responsive
heartstring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said in a thick voice as
he turned to leave the office.</p>

<p>Jeff was considerably disturbed by the developments
of the morning and he went to his classes
in a strangely confused and upset state of mind.
Indeed, it was not until the noon recess period,
just before the mid-day meal, that he managed
to get control of himself again, and then only
after he had had a long talk with his roommate,
Wade Grenville.</p>

<p>“Whe-e-w-w-w,” whistled Wade, when Jeff unburdened
himself to his chum, “of all the rotten
dirty, skunky tricks in the world, there never
was a worse one than that. And believe me, old
kid, I think I know the birds who did it.”</p>

<p>“Who?” said Jeff, in a manner indicating
clearly that he, too, had already made up his
mind as to who was at the bottom of it all.</p>

<p>“Why, Gould and Birdie Pell, of course. There
aren’t any other fellows in the school who would
stoop to a trick as low as that,” said Wade with
conviction.</p>

<p>“Well, I suspect Gould myself. But—er—well,
I can’t believe Pell would do anything like that,”
said Jeff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“Tut-tut—he’s as bad as Gould. Wouldn’t
wonder but that Gould had talked him into doing
it and kept his own skirts clean.”</p>

<p>“No, no. I can’t believe that,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty rotten set up just the same—and—by
jingoes something should be done about
it. Something—er—say, Jeff, this is a matter
for we students to take a hand in. By jingoes,
we’ve got to find the cowards who are responsible
and show them up. I’m for that. I’ll get Buck
Hart and Rabbit Warren and Lafe Gammage and
Honey Wiggins and a couple others and we’ll find
the skunk who did it or—”</p>

<p>“No. Don’t do that, Wade. Don’t—”</p>

<p>“Tut-tut, Little One. You haven’t got a word
to say. I’m going to run this end of it. Not a
word now. I’ll tell you all about it after the
thing is all over,” said Wade.</p>

<p>And in spite of Jeff’s best efforts to persuade
his roommate not to interfere Wade took it upon
himself to spread the news of what had happened
among all of Jeff’s friends, and organize his
special little committee of students who were to
take it upon themselves to smoke out the fellow
or fellows behind the “frame up” as they chose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
to call it. Indeed, Wade worked so well that by
the end of the afternoon session the committee’s
plans were all laid, but he refused to divulge
anything to Jeff.</p>

<p>But during the afternoon a new development
entered the situation, which, while it helped matters
a little, did not tend to remove all suspicion
from Jeff. At about the time the baseball men
were gathering at the gym. for the regular afternoon
practice word was sent to Jeff’s room to report
to Dr. Livingston again. He was quick to
obey the summons and at the office he found Professor
Hatfield in conference with Dr. Livingston.</p>

<p>“Thatcher,” said Dr. Livingston, “Professor
Hatfield has just shed some light on the unpleasant
situation we were discussing this morning,
and while it does not entirely clear you from
having the Latin examination paper in your possession
it does absolve you and every other boy
in the school from the breach of school honor in
entering Room 44. Professor Hatfield has charge
of that room, as you know, and he is the custodian
of the examination papers. He tells me
that yesterday at noon he entered the room and
took a copy of the Freshman Latin examination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
away with him, putting it in his inside pocket, so
he believed. But when he went to look for it late
last night he discovered that it was gone. He
has tried to trace back in his memory how he
might have been responsible for its disappearance
and he has come to the conclusion that he
must have lost it out of his pocket while crossing
the campus. That explains the paper missing
from Room 44 and it removes any suspicion
that you or any one else had broken the school’s
code of honor and entered Room 44 without permission.
Now, then, Thatcher, that brings me to
the point of asking you more questions and I
want you on your honor as a gentleman to answer
me truthfully and take your punishment if punishment
is coming to you.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Livingston, I am always truthful, and I
have always taken whatever punishment is coming
to me in a manly fashion, I believe,” said
Jeff.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you have,” said the Headmaster.</p>

<p>“What questions do you want to ask me,
then?” asked Jeff.</p>

<p>“Did you find the paper Professor Hatfield
lost?” asked Dr. Livingston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“You are sure you did not pick it up, and
noting what it was decided to look it over first
before reporting it and returning it to me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I never saw the paper before you
showed it to me this morning, sir,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“All right, but the evidence is against you,
Thatcher, and I must still deny you certain privileges.
You will be permitted to take the final
examinations. We will work out a new set of
Latin questions, so as to be certain that this
missing paper has not passed through more than
your hands. But you must remain within bounds,
be in your room at the hour I designated this
morning, and you cannot take part in any athletic
contests whatsoever until this case is cleared up
and we know all the facts. Go to your room,
boy.”</p>

<p>Feeling somewhat relieved, but still angry and
resentful that any one should play such an ugly
trick on him, Jeff returned to Carter Hall. As
he crossed the campus he looked out toward the
ball field where the team was at afternoon practice,
and he bit his lips in disappointment. Because
of the dishonesty of some one else he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
thought he was forbidden the privilege of practicing
with the team, forbidden the privilege of
playing in the remaining games and especially
the Lawrencetown game nest week. That would
mean that he would not win his letter. That
would mean— Jeff stopped short in his tracks.
Suddenly a thought occurred to him. Had Gould
found the examination paper and used it to keep
him out of the Lawrencetown game! If he played
in the Lawrencetown game Gould would not win
his letter. But if he remained ineligible, Gould
was the logical man to take his place and in
playing the game he would win the honor he most
coveted. Had Gould planted the lost examination
paper in his Latin book just to keep him out of
the Lawrencetown game? Jeff began to believe
that it was very likely.</p>

<p>Jeff’s non-appearance at practice that afternoon
caused a number of questions to be raised
by the players and students who always watched
the team warm up, and Wade Grenville was not
slow in supplying the information as to just what
had happened and why Jeff was being denied the
privilege of practicing with the team and playing
in the remaining games of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>The attitude of practically all of the fellows
was the same. They asserted that a mighty low-down
trick had been played on the third baseman,
and even Gould, who was filling Jeff’s place,
seemed to profess to be disturbed by the unfairness
of it all, and was loud in his insistence that
if Thatcher was not responsible for his own
undoing, the fellow who stooped to such meanness
should be smoked out and made to confess.</p>

<p>But Wade refused to be deceived by what he
believed was a bit of stage play on the part of
Gould, and he refused to accept the attitude of
Birdie Pell as anything but sham. Yet, Birdie
appeared to be very resentful of the way Thatcher
had been “framed” as dishonest, and he insisted
that he would do his utmost to help find the
fellow who was responsible.</p>

<p>When Wade heard him make this statement he
looked at the little Soph more searchingly for a
moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Well, Pell, I guess you won’t have to look
far among <em>your</em> friends to find out who did it.”</p>

<p>Little Pell colored up at this and seemed about
to make a retort. Instead, however, he bit his lips
and turned away in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>In the locker room that afternoon Wade passed
secret word among certain of Jeff’s friends, suggesting
that they linger about the gym. a little later
than usual.</p>

<p>Buck Hart, Honey Wiggins, Rabbit Warren,
Cas Gorham, Brownie Davis and Mickey Daily
composed the little group who remained behind
in the locker room after the rest of the baseball
squad had left. Wade became the spokesman at
this impromptu meeting.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “I believe Jeff has had a
mighty shabby deal put over on him by some one,
and I think it is up to us to find out who did it.
I don’t mind saying I have my suspicions and I
for one am going to try and get at the facts in
the case. I’ve been thinking that perhaps a little
committee composed of the few of us here might
be able to do more in the way of shedding light
on the whole business than Dr. Livingston and
the rest of the members of the faculty can.
Thatcher doesn’t like my idea of getting you all
together. He calls it gang spirit, or mob rule,
or Ku Klux stuff, but just the same I think we
can help a lot toward getting this mystery
cleared up if we work together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“Sounds good,” said Lafe Gammage.</p>

<p>“Right-o. What’s the idea, Wade?” said
Mickey Daily.</p>

<p>“We’re with you, Wade. Count us all in and
give us the dope,” said Rabbit Warren.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the way I figure it, fellows.
I think that Gould is at the bottom of the whole
thing. I’m going to interview him in his room
to-night, and if I can’t make any progress with
him, I want you fellows to be ready to come in
and help me out. Not physically—that is, not
unless we have to. But I don’t believe that we’ll
need to use force. Just the presence of you fellows
all in a group will go a long way toward
making Gould understand that he will have to
come across with facts and not try to lie out of
anything.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’re with you. Aren’t we, fellows?”
asked Buck Hart.</p>

<p>“I’ll say we are. Right-o,” came the response.</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll go to Gould’s room at eight
o’clock. You fellows gather around outside about
that time and be handy. No use of us all piling
in on top of him right off. We’ll give him a
chance first. All right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“Right as can be,” came the response. And
the meeting broke up, the fellows leaving the
gym. in a group.</p>

<p>Wade refused to discuss his plans with Jeff at
all that evening, although Jeff tried his best to
learn them.</p>

<p>“Never mind what we plan to do, Jeff, but we
are going to get to the bottom of this thing if we
can,” said Wade.</p>

<p>“All right, hang it. If you won’t let me in on
it I can’t make you. But let me tell you, Wade,
I don’t want any gang stuff or strong arm
methods or anything like that. Don’t stoop as
low as that for me, Wade. The whole thing
isn’t worth it,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t. I’ll promise you we won’t use
force under any circumstances, but we are going
to see the thing through, let me tell you.” And
Wade picked up his hat and went out.</p>

<p>Jeff was half inclined to follow him. Indeed,
he took up his hat to do so when he realized that
it was eight o’clock and that he was not permitted
the privilege of leaving his room at that
hour.</p>

<p>Wade crossed over the campus and went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
straight to Newkirk, in which most of the Sophomores
were quartered. On the front step of the
house he found Rabbit Warren and Honey Wiggins
waiting and several other fellows were
coming down the drive. He could make out
their forms in the gathering half light of evening.</p>

<p>“Wait here, fellows. I’ll whistle if I want
you,” said Wade, and he entered and went upstairs
to the second floor.</p>

<p>As he walked in the direction in which Gould’s
room lay, he suddenly became conscious of voices
raised to more than conversational pitch which
sounded rather strange in the silent hall.</p>

<p>As Wade approached Gould’s room he presently
recognized the voice speaking as that of
Birdie Pell, and he could not resist the impulse
to stop and listen. They were in Gould’s room
and the transom above the door was open.</p>

<p>“—and I’ve stuck by you through a lot of
messes,” Pell was saying, “but, by jingoes, if you
are implicated in this I’m through with you,
cousin or no cousin. I don’t care a whoop
whether your father does get miffed and refuse
to pay my expenses here. By jingoes, I’ll work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
my way through and be quit of a dirty mucker
like you.”</p>

<p>“But, Birdie, I didn’t do it, I tell you. You
can’t believe I would be as low down as that, can
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, but, by jingoes, you have made
yourself such a crab around the school that Wade
Grenville and all of Thatcher’s friends suspect
you and are perfectly willing to believe that you
would do it. And if you didn’t do it you and I
have got to find out who did, just to clear you.
Get me. Hang it, you make me so mad sometimes
I’d give you a good beating if I was big
enough. If you hadn’t been such a darned
grouch and crab, and so conceited and pig headed
you wouldn’t be under suspicion now. You don’t
suppose I like to have you act—”</p>

<p>In justice to his own conscience Wade could
not listen any longer and he knocked at the door.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Gould,
in a husky voice, said:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>The boy was pale of face and visibly overwrought
when Wade stepped in and closed the
door after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“I know what you’ve come for,” he said, in a
voice that trembled. “But I swear to you, Wade,
I do not know a single thing about it. I may be
a ‘mucker,’ as Birdie has called me to-night, but
honestly, Wade, I’m not as low down as all that.”
Gould was so sincere and so overwrought that
Wade could see tears in his eyes and his voice
choked.</p>

<p>Jeff’s chum felt dreadfully sorry for him and
almost half inclined to believe that he was telling
the truth.</p>

<p>“Look here, Gould, I’m not the only fellow who
believes that you had a hand in this. They are
all downstairs. Can you go down and tell them
what you have told me. If you can I believe you
are honest. If you can’t, why, it will—”</p>

<p>Gould swallowed hard, seemed to grow a shade
paler, and made a valiant effort to pull himself
together.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down. I want to tell them all that they
are mistaken. I must be a mucker to have them
<em>all</em> believe me capable of such a low-down trick.”
Gould got his cap, and followed Wade out into
the hall and down the stairs, and Birdie, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
feeling very unhappy for his chum, trailed
after them.</p>

<p>Rabbit Warren and Honey Wiggins were still
sitting on the steps while Mickey Daily and the
others stood under an elm tree near by. As the
three boys came out of the door they all gathered
in a little group at the foot of the steps expectantly.
Wade stepped aside to give Gould the
opportunity to face them, and the former third
baseman stepped forward and stood in front of
them for a moment.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, in a husky voice, “Wade
and Birdie Pell have told me that you believe
that I planted that Latin examination paper in
Jeff Thatcher’s book and left the book where it
would be found and turned in so that he would
be blamed for dishonesty and barred from the
team. I want to tell you all that I do not know
any more about the whole thing than you do, and
that’s the honest truth. I want you to believe it
is the truth, too. It makes me mighty unhappy
to know that you can all think me capable of such
an act, but it makes me realize, too, that I have
probably been a cheap, rotten sort of a skate for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
some time. I want you all to overlook that and
give me another chance to be a regular fellow. I
tell you I never stooped to anything as low as the
deed you are accusing me of, and if you do not
believe me I will do anything that you fellows
say to—”</p>

<p>Gould did not finish his sentence. Out of the
dark came the sound of feet running up the
graveled drive, and presently a figure burst upon
the scene. It was Jeff Thatcher, hatless and out
of breath.</p>

<p>“Good, I hoped I’d find you all here. Fellows,
it’s a mistake, thank goodness. Ollie Simms, the
janitor, is responsible for the whole business.
Here’s how it all happened. He has just been
over to Dr. Livingston’s office and explained, and
Dr. Livingston called me in to let me know all
about it. Seems Ollie found the examination
paper on the path across the campus while he
was on the way over to the gym., and on the basement
steps he found my Cæsar, where I must
have lost it out of my coat pocket. He shoved
the paper into the book and intended to bring
them over to the office. But he got busy with
something else and he laid the book on the gym.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
steps and forgot about it. Little Jimmy Wild,
a sub-freshman, found it and turned it in to the
office. So there is the solution of the whole business
and I am exonerated. And now, what I
want to do is to apologize to Gould here for the
ugly thoughts I have had about him and the ugly
deeds I have believed him capable of.”</p>

<p>Jeff stepped up the steps and extended his hand
to Gould and his former enemy gripped it with
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Jeff,” he stammered, “I must have
been carrying myself like a mucker these last
few months to make you believe I could be
capable of such a deed. <em>I</em> want to apologize for
that and I want to apologize for many other
things too. That basketball foul last winter, for
instance. I lied then, Jeff. That was a mucker’s
trick that I have regretted ever since. I’m going
to be a regular fellow after this or I’m going to
quit Pennington.”</p>

<p>Buck Hart and Wade Grenville stepped up
followed by the others.</p>

<p>“We, too, want to apologize, Gould. We are
blamed sorry, but, honestly, you have laid yourself
open to it with your lax ways, your smoking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
your egotism and some of the shady stunts you
have pulled in the past. But we are all willing
to let that stuff be far in the past. We are for
you, Gould, and little Birdie Pell here, too.”</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Gould, “Birdie Pell is about
the best chum a fellow could have. He’s stuck to
me through a lot of what must have been to him
discouraging situations and he has always tried to
make me see how rotten I have been, but I guess
I have been such an infernal egotist that I have
not been willing to pay much attention to him.
He’s my cousin, fellows, and a dandy kid. But
even his relationship did not stand in the way of
his throwing me down to-night when he thought
I had stooped to such a low trick as I was accused
of.”</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Wade Grenville, “we’ve been
misjudging these two chaps a heap, and I guess
I’m a lot responsible for some of the unpleasant
feelings we have all held against them. I propose
a yell for both of them.”</p>

<p>The “rahs” were given with enthusiasm and
echoed across the campus with such feeling that
presently heads were appearing at various windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“And now,” yelled Buck Hart, “let’s give the
same to Jeff Thatcher because I think of us all
he has been the most tolerant.”</p>

<p>And Jeff Thatcher heard his name go echoing
through the night on the end of nine rousing
“rahs.”</p>

<small>THE BIG GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The days immediately preceding the final examinations
were long dreary days of hard work and
very little time for thoughts of baseball for Jeff
or any of the other fellows at Pennington. They
were not even relieved by a mid-week game nor
was the afternoon practice carried on for any
extended period. All of the fellows were too
much worried and fretted by their school work.
But they did have events of real importance to
look forward to after the examinations were
held and they were, in the order of their importance
to Jeff, the final game of the season with
Lawrencetown and the commencement “hop” and
various other “spreads” that immediately preceded
or followed the game.</p>

<p>That Lawrencetown game loomed up to
Thatcher as the most important event in his
school career so far, and he looked forward to it
with a tremendous lot of interest. Perhaps it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
was this enthusiasm that carried him through
the deadly examination week and kept him from
growing gray with study. Still, he was mighty
glad when the last exam was over and he could
fare forth to the gym. and the baseball field,
light hearted and unburdened with worries about
his scholastic standing.</p>

<p>The last examination occurred on Wednesday
afternoon, and Jeff answered the last problem
with a suppressed cheer and turned in his paper.
He felt as if a load had dropped from his shoulders
with that act, and he made haste to quit the
study hall and hurry over to the gym. to get on
his baseball togs.</p>

<p>He found Wade and Honey Wiggins in the
locker room ahead of him and they were as
jubilant as he was, and while he was getting into
his duds more and more members of the team
came straggling in, all bearing happy grins to
know that the unpleasant period was behind
them.</p>

<p>“Whew-w-w. <em>That’s</em> all over, thank goodness,”
said Captain Tad Sloan. “All over but
the shouting. They will announce our marks
after chapel to-morrow morning. Let’s hope we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
all pass. Anyhow, now for a real practice. Come
on. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>A real practice it proved to be, the fellows
cavorting on the diamond until dinner time. And
whatever mental disquietude remained was dispersed
next morning when the marks were announced
from the chapel platform, and it was
made evident that every fellow on the baseball
squad passed with flying colors. That meant that
none of them would be disqualified or dropped
from the team because of a poor scholastic
record, and the way was wide open for the team
to prepare itself for the big contest.</p>

<p>Thursday afternoon practice was just as good
as Wednesday’s had been, and Friday the team
warmed up in its preparations by playing a sizzling
five-inning game with the Penguins, who
were brought together again for the especial purpose
of giving the big team a good work out.
There was a mass meeting in chapel on Friday
evening at which the cheer leaders stirred the
student body into a perfect frenzy of cheer and
song, and made them so worked up to have the
scalp of Lawrencetown that it began to look as if
the baseball diamond would be the scene of a mob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
encounter or something equally as dreadful. New
school yells were developed for the occasion, and
practiced until the chapel rafters rang. All the
members of the team were brought up on the
platform one by one (much to the consternation
of Jeff and a number of other more or less
bashful spirits), and as each appeared they were
roundly cheered by the enthusiastic and thoroughly
excited students. Altogether it was really
a thrilling scene and Jeff became as excited as
any of the rest of them.</p>

<p>Jeff and Wade went to bed that night so thoroughly
keyed up that it was some time before
either of them could get to sleep. And when they
did finally drop off it seemed to them as if they
had only had their eyes closed about five minutes
when the seven o’clock bell sounded, and they
awoke to the realization that it was Saturday
morning and that the day of the big contest of
the year was actually at hand.</p>

<p>Attendance at chapel was the only school work
required of the boys that day, and after the
morning services were over the students flocked
to the campus, where in the fine warm June sunshine,
for the day was perfectly wonderful, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
gathered in little groups to discuss the game.
Some dashed off to the railroad station to meet
the eleven o’clock train which would bring in
loads of parents, friends and bright-eyed, prettily
frocked girl friends, eager to attend the game and
the “hop” after.</p>

<p>Jeff and Wade, having no friends of this sort
to greet them, mingled with the fellows on the
campus or on the steps of the school buildings
until noon time when the call for dinner stirred
them to action.</p>

<p>The noonday meal in the big mess hall proved
to be more than a meal; it resembled a continuation
of the mass meeting the day before in which
the cheer leaders stirred up the boys to the point
of singing enthusiastically, and “<em>Pennington, old
Pennington</em>” swelled forth in such a mighty
chorus that little prickles raced up and down Jeff
Thatcher’s spine as he heard the chorus roared,
and just at that moment he, and doubtless every
other boy in the room, would have laid down
his life if need be for the honor of the school.</p>

<p>The fellows piled out of the dining hall still
singing and then, because it was one o’clock and
the game was called at two-thirty, they all scattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
to their rooms to “doll up” for the benefit
of the horde of pretty girls who would be present,
as indicated from the number who already had
appeared and were strolling across the campus,
with boy companions or with attentive parents.</p>

<p>Jeff and Wade, with a peculiar, nervous feeling,
in the vicinity of their belts, for want of
something better to do, went down in the locker
room and got out their fielding mitts, which they
proceeded to “work” into better shape by generous
applications of saliva, soap suds, oil and
other “dope” that had been recommended to
them from various quarters. They meant to
have their gloves in the pink of condition.</p>

<p>The call to get into uniform was sounded at
one o’clock, but that was hardly necessary for by
that hour the entire squad was in the locker room
getting into their duds. Shortly after the head
coach appeared there was a blare of brass out on
the campus, and a ringing cheer, and the fellows
all crowded to the basement windows to peer out
at a line of fifteen yellow automobile busses that
came careening up the long gravel drive, to come
to a stop in front of the Administration Building.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
This was the Lawrencetown team and
rooters, arriving for the fray.</p>

<p>Led by the band the rooters gathered in a
column four abreast and started to parade
around the campus, later turning in the direction
of the baseball diamond where they took up their
section of the bleachers and forthwith began to
hurl challenges at the now crowded buff and blue
stands along third base line. Cheer for cheer
was hurled across the diamond while the rooters
waited for the teams to appear.</p>

<p>Lawrencetown was given locker room in the
basement of the Administration Building, and
while they were getting into their uniforms the
Pennington team completed that ordeal and appeared
in a group on the steps of the gymnasium
building where the Pennington band was waiting
for them. Immediately the school’s marching
song pealed forth, and the players, with Mr. Rice
and Mr. Clarkson leading, and Captain Tad
directly behind them, started across the campus
for the field.</p>

<p>As they came into sight of the bleachers, a
wild cheer started that rolled on and on and developed
into a thunder-like roar as they finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
reached the center of the diamond where they
were scattered to their positions by the coach,
while the school band took its place in the stands.</p>

<p>Warming up practice started with enthusiasm
for the fellows had suppressed themselves so long
that only a lot of vigorous physical action could
serve to “let them down” and bring them back
to normal.</p>

<p>Dutch Hecht found his particular mace and
began “batting ’em out” to the outfielders, while
Captain Tad, the sturdy little catcher, began to
slash some hot ones to Jeff and the rest of the
infield.</p>

<p>It was surely snappy practice and before long
the Pennington rooters began to realize that their
team was at the very top of its form and that if
the Lawrencetown aggregation were as good,
they were destined to see a game that would be
historic.</p>

<p>And the Lawrencetown players soon proved
that they were in every bit as good form. A wild
cheer greeted their appearance about twenty
minutes after the Pennington fellows had arrived
on the field, and, of course, the home team came
in to the bench while the fellows wearing the red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and black stocking of the visiting aggregation
took the field. There was snap to their practice,
too. The infield worked as smoothly as a well-oiled
machine, and their lightning-like handling
of the ball, their snappy throws and remarkable
“get” soon had even the Pennington rooters on
their toes.</p>

<p>“They are good, mighty good, and you boys
are going to know you were in a game when you
get through to-day,” said Coach Rice. Then,
looking at his watch, he added, “Come on, Tad.
They are coming in now and here comes the
umpire. Get your men out into the field. Here’s
the batting order.”</p>

<p>Jeff, who was pulling on his glove, looked over
Tad’s shoulder to read the line-up of players.
He noticed with interest that the batting order
had been shifted slightly. Long Lafe Gammage
led off, with Mickey Daily next in line and walloping
Dutch Hecht third man up. They were
the “big stickers” of the outfit. Captain Tad
followed and Wade Grenville came in fifth. Jed
Stafford, also a reliable clouter, was sixth. He
found his own name seventh, Buck Hart eighth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and pitcher George Dixon last in line, though big
George was not a weak batter as pitchers go.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, let’s give ’em both barrels—all
we got. Win the game in the first inning if
we can but play hard all the way through,” said
Captain Tad. “Come on. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>The fellows romped out to their positions and
big George Dixon, with his slow deliberate stride,
walked out to the pitcher’s box, spat into his
glove, took the shining new ball that the umpire
offered him, and turned to face the batter: the
first man up of the Lawrencetown team, a chap
by the name of Southers, who played second base
and was a formidable batter.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Southers pulled down the peak of his cap and
stepped to the plate.</p>

<p>Captain Tad thumped his fist into his mitt.
“Come on, George. Get this first one. On your
toes, fellows. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>George Dixon wound up his long arms, then
uncurled like a steel spring. There was a flash
of white between the box and the catcher, a
thump, and the umpire shouted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Strike one.”</p>

<p>The big game of the season was on.</p>

<p>In spite of that auspicious start, however,
George Dixon did not strike the first man out.
He managed to get two and two on him and then
tried to sneak over the necessary third strike.
But Southers saw it was a tempting offering and
slammed it for a beautiful long fly which found
safety in the hands of Wade Grenville out in right
field.</p>

<p>“One down. That’s the way they all have to
go to-day. Give ’em the gate. Get this guy
now,” came the peppery coaching from all corners
of the diamond as the ball was relayed in
to Dixon and Wild, first baseman of the red and
black team, selected his particular mace and
stepped to the plate. He was a versatile batter,
and as he stepped into position he shifted about
and decided to bat left handed against Dixon.</p>

<p>“Left or right. It doesn’t make any difference
to you, George, ol’ boy. Put the bee on this boy.
Thatta boy.”</p>

<p>Wild was a wily batter. He drew three balls
before Dixon settled down to pitch to him, and
then he poked the first good ball down to Buck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
Hart on a sizzling liner that Buck fielded to perfection
and plunked into Lafe Gammage’s hands
in plenty of time.</p>

<p>“Two gone. One more left,” coached Captain
Tad, as he thumped his mitt and gave Dixon the
signal. And Dixon, pitching to Freeman, the big
left fielder of the Lawrencetown team, the
heaviest hitter of them all, settled down and
struck him out with four pitched balls, retiring
the side.</p>

<p>The team came in and as Jeff walked toward
the bench he looked up into the crowd along third
base line and grinned, for there he saw Mr.
Davidson, President of the Third National Bank
of New City, sitting in the stand beside a charming
lady whom Jeff concluded was Mrs. Davidson.
As the banker caught Jeff’s eye he waved
to him and called:</p>

<p>“I’m out to see you fellows win the big game,
Jeff.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll win it for you, Mr. Davidson,”
said Jeff lifting his cap.</p>

<p>Long Lafe was at the plate tapping his bat on
the rubber and pulling down his cap when Jeff
took his seat on the players’ bench beside Wade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Lefty Wells, the southpaw pitching ace of the
Lawrencetown team was in the box adjusting his
glove, and Captain Tad was on the first base
line coaching.</p>

<p>“Show ’em where you live, Lafe,” called Tad.</p>

<p>The good-natured first baseman grinned as
Wells wound up and shot a swift one over for a
strike. He tried another of the same kind but
Lafe, who was set for a slam, slashed at it and
sent a Texas leaguer humming over the second
baseman’s head into short center for a single.</p>

<p>“Wow, the first man on. Here’s where you
score, Lafe,” shouted Tad, as he passed the signals
he took from the coach on to Mickey Daily
the next man up.</p>

<p>Obedient Mickey struck at the first ball over
and hit it, trying hard to make the sacrifice play
he was instructed to. But Bradley, the Lawrencetown
shortstop, covered a little more ground
than Daily thought he could and what was meant
for a sacrifice resulted in a neat double play,
Gammage and Daily going out in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Well, we got one big man left,” coached Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
Tad as ponderous Dutch Hecht stepped up,
spat on his hands and took a squint at Wells.
The Lawrencetown man knew how formidable
Hecht was from previous experience with him
and he was taking no chances. He never pitched
to the left fielder at all and passed him to first
on five pitched balls.</p>

<p>Little Tad had come in from the coaching box
for he was on deck, and as Hecht lumbered to
first Tad stepped to the rubber with a look of
determination on his face. But there were two
down and the best that the captain could do was
to lace a grounder down to Dick Leslie, the Lawrencetown
third baseman, who promptly threw
Hecht out at second and retired the side. The
score was 0 to 0 at the end of the first inning.</p>

<p>Nothing scintillating marked the second or the
third innings. Both Dixon and Wells were pitching
at the top of their form and with the best
sort of support behind them the batters went
down in almost one, two, three order, only two
Pennington men reached first base in the two
innings and only one Lawrencetown man got a
clean hit, a slashing double by Taylor, the red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
and black team’s center fielder. But the hit went
for nothing for the next man up could not advance
the runner and his out retired the side.</p>

<p>The beginning of the fourth, however, was different.
Freeman, the slugger of the Lawrencetown
aggregation, was the first man up and
Dixon, although he tried to play safe, put one of
the variety that Freeman most liked within his
reach and he landed on it for a two base clout
into deep right field.</p>

<p>Oleson, the Lawrencetown catcher, and no mean
man with the stick, was up next, and on the first
ball pitched he poled out a single that all but
scored Freeman. The heavy hitter rounded third
and started for home when the Lawrencetown
coach on the third base line warned him back to
the base.</p>

<p>With a man on first and third and none out it
looked serious for Dixon and the Pennington
team. And it was serious. Miller, the Lawrencetown
right fielder, was next up and he slammed
a hot one to Buck Hart, Freeman going down
with the crack of the bat. Buck played the man
going home and with a lightning-like throw to
Tad Sloan, nailed him at the plate. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
such a close call at being a score that it gave the
Pennington rooters heart trouble for a moment.
Still, there were two men on, and only one out
and a single meant that two runs would come in.
And center fielder Taylor, already credited with
a hit, was at the bat.</p>

<p>He made good a second time, lacing a single
into short right field, and Oleson and Miller
rounded third and started for home hardly
twenty feet apart. Oleson made it standing up
but little Tad was crouched over the rubber waiting
for the ball as Miller came thundering down
from third, and Wade Grenville with a fine throw
shot it down into Tad’s mitt just as the runner
slid feet first for the plate. Tad and Miller were
all tangled up when the dust cleared away. The
umpire signaled that Miller was out, and the little
Pennington captain got to his feet with a look
of pain on his face. His stocking was ripped
down the shin and blood was oozing from a
nasty spike wound that he had received in the
mêlée.</p>

<p>When Miller saw what he had done he scrambled
to his feet and put his arm around Tad’s
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“Sorry, old fellow,” he said. “That’s tough,
but I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing. Could have been much worse,”
said Tad bravely, as he walked over to pick up
his cage, limping slightly as he did so. Then he
turned and shouted:</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows. Two down. Play the
batter,” and he got a round of hearty applause
from the bleachers and a rousing cheer besides,
both for the fine play he had made and the gameness
he showed after being spiked.</p>

<p>Play the batter they did. He was Dick Leslie,
not a particularly strong hitter, and his best
efforts netted Thatcher an assist for he scooped
up a humming grounder and shot it over to Lafe
Gammage with a will. Then the side came in and
Captain Tad went over to the bench where Dr.
Stout was waiting with some bandage and iodine
to patch up his wounds.</p>

<p>Unfortunate Dave Gleason, still limping slightly
from his injury sustained early in the season,
crawled under the ropes and came over to the
bench to congratulate Tad.</p>

<p>“Hope it isn’t as serious as mine was, old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
fellow,” he said as he slapped the captain on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Nothing to it, old dear,” said Tad heartily
as he made a wry face while Dr. Stout poured
iodine into the wound.</p>

<p>But the Pennington players could not get to
Wells as the Lawrencetown batters had reached
Dixon. Wells never wavered and his port side
delivery was as deadly in the fourth as it had
been in the third, second and first; more deadly
if anything for he struck the first and third men
out while the second batter up, who happened to
be Wade Grenville, was out on a high fly that the
center fielder did not have to move twenty feet
to get. The score at the end of the fourth was
1 to 0 in favor of the Lawrencetown aggregation,
and the Pennington boys went into the field with
the realization that they were up against a fighting
team of ball players who were out to earn a
victory and had a pretty clear idea of how they
had to earn it.</p>

<p>The fifth inning opened auspiciously for the
visitors. Shortstop Bradley lammed one just out
of reach of Thatcher, for a single. But he tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
to reach second while Dixon was pitching to Wells,
the Lawrencetown pitcher. That was where he
made his big mistake, for Captain Tad was waiting
for just such an attempt, and he shot the ball
down to Buck Hart, who had slipped over to second
when the play started, and Bradley slid right
into a neat put out, while the stands went wild
with cheers for Tad and Hart. Wells went down
after the next two balls were pitched, for he was
a weak hitter, and Wild came up for the third
man.</p>

<p>With two down Dixon played the batter, feeling
that the support behind him could hold Wild down.
The team so far had played an errorless game
and he felt reasonably safe in pitching to the Lawrencetown
batter.</p>

<p>The second ball across seemed to be just what
Wild was waiting for and he leaned on it with all
his strength. It was a wicked slash, and like a
cannonball it crashed right back at Dixon. Before
the pitcher could set himself to field it, it hit
him on the elbow and made him double up with
a grunt of pain. The ball bounded off between
first and second and Daily fielded it and shot it
down to Gammage in time to put out the runner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>The coach and Dr. Stout met Dixon as he walked
off the diamond rubbing his arm, and they paused
a moment to feel of the injured member. Dr.
Stout looked serious as he felt about with practiced
fingers.</p>

<p>“That was a wicked ball, Dixon, and I’m afraid—yes—I
think there is a slight fracture of the end
of the bone there. That settles your pitching for
to-day, anyway. Too bad. Come over to the
bench while I fix you up.”</p>

<p>“Wiggins, you warm up. You’ll have to go in
next inning,” called the coach. “Gould, take
Tad’s mitt and catch Wiggins for a while.”</p>

<p>Captain Tad became active immediately. He
saw that the loss of Dixon might have a disheartening
effect upon the Pennington players and he
began to talk to them as only he knew how to
talk.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows. Up and at ’em. We’ve got
to get them for this. It was an accident, of course,
but let’s show ’em that it’s when we get hurt the
most we fight the best. Thatcher, you are up first.
Come on and do something. We want a hit from
you. Go to it, old boy.”</p>

<p>Tad’s spirit of fight was infectious and Jeff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
went to the plate with a determination to make
good that made him almost formidable.</p>

<p>Wells pitched to him, for doubtless he held Jeff
lightly as a batter. The Pennington third baseman
had not done anything notable with the stick
so far that day.</p>

<p>The first one over was a ball. The next was a
clean strike that Jeff let pass, and the next ball
would have been the same, but Jeff interrupted its
career with a vicious swing that smashed out a
sizzling single; a clean hit.</p>

<p>“Wow, on your toes. This is our night to
howl,” yelled Tad, hurrying over to the coach
line.</p>

<p>“Go down with his arm,” he signaled Jeff, and
Thatcher, obeying the captain, started for second
on the first ball pitched, while Buck Hart, at the
bat, stabbed at the ball but purposely missed it.
Jeff saw Southers, the second baseman, set himself
to catch the throw and he slid. In a cloud of
dust he clutched the bag and looked up to see
Southers recovering a fumbled ball. He made
a mental note as he stood up and brushed himself
off that that was the first error of the game.</p>

<p>Now, if ever, it was time for Pennington to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
score. With a man on second and none out, it was
the opportunity of the game, and the Pennington
players determined to take advantage of it. A
single of the right sort could bring in a run, or
at best move Thatcher on to third. Buck Hart
spat on his hands, and with one strike on him
settled down to the business at hand. And he was
equal to the task, for presently he found Wells’
delivery for a hit that somehow got between third
and short and enough out of reach to allow
Thatcher to get to third, while Buck romped safely
to first.</p>

<p>With a man on first and third and none out,
scoring looked like a certainty, and the Pennington
bleachers went into a frenzy of cheering,
while the band blared forth a spirited school
song.</p>

<p>Jeff, from third, looked toward the bench, curious
to know who would be put up next. It was
Dixon’s turn at bat, but Jeff realized that the
pitcher could not take his place. Who would be
put in to bat for him?</p>

<p>Watching the players’ bench, Jeff saw Coach
Rice look the fellows over and motion to Gould.
He said something to him, too, and slapped him on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
the back, and as Jeff saw that his rival for third
base honors was going into the game as a pinch
hitter he was thrilled with delight, for he realized,
as the jubilant Gould did, that going in as a pinch
hitter would mean that he would be credited with
playing in the Lawrencetown game and as a result
be awarded his ’varsity letter. Jeff was as much
pleased as if it were himself who was being given
the opportunity to make good, and he called down
from third base encouragingly:</p>

<p>“Land on it, Gould, for a single. That’s all we
need to tie things up.”</p>

<p>Gould grinned at him as he selected his bat and
stepped to the plate, and Jeff hoped mightily that
the pinch hitter would make good.</p>

<p>He did. Gould was capable, and when put to it
could do as well as any fellow on the field. And
there was resolution and determination behind the
vicious swing that he took at the first pitched ball.</p>

<p>He connected in earnest and the sphere shot toward
right field in a long, low arc that started
Miller running back as hard as he could. But it
was quickly evident that he would never catch
that drive, and Jeff and Buck Hart romped home,
while Gould tore around the bases as fast as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
could go. It was a clean three-bagger, and had
Gould been contented to remain on third he might
have ultimately scored. But in his enthusiasm he
tried to stretch it into a home run and he was
caught at the plate. But he was given a hand
and a rousing cheer when he stood up and brushed
himself off, for the crowd recognized that he had
brought in two runs and put Pennington in the
lead; indeed, pandemonium reigned for some time,
for the Pennington rooters had been hoping for
just such a break in the game and they cheered
themselves almost voiceless when it finally occurred.</p>

<p>But out of trouble once more and with one down
the Lawrencetown pitcher tightened up and the
next two batters were played out both on infield
hits, and the team retired with the score 2 to 1 in
Pennington’s favor at the end of the fifth.</p>

<p>Considerably heartened, the team took to the
field determined to play air-tight ball behind
Honey Wiggins, who made his way to the box,
while a cheer with his name tacked on the end of
it resounded from the bleachers. Honey was no
slouch at pitching. He had been going well all
season and improving steadily, until now he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
almost as capable as big George Dixon, so his
team mates had little doubt concerning his ability
to make a good showing.</p>

<p>And he did. Although he was pitching against a
fighting team, a team one run behind and determined
to fight itself out of the hole and back to
an advantage again, he held them down to three
scattered hits in the succeeding three innings, and
in the sixth and seventh sessions he struck out
one batter, while in the eighth, although he passed
the second man up and permitted the man following
to find him for a hit, he held the succeeding
two men down to infield drives that retired the
side without a score.</p>

<p>In the same sessions, however, the Pennington
crew could not do any better. Wells never broke
in his steady pitching nor did the team behind
him falter at all. They played the finest kind of
baseball, and try as the Pennington players did
they could not break through the wonderful defense,
of an impregnable infield and an outfield
that seemed to cover every foot of territory with
extreme ease. In the eighth inning the Pennington
batters began to find Wells more readily than
they had any inning before save the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
fifth, but that was where his fine support helped
him out; although every fellow up landed on his
delivery, and two safe hits were made, the five
batters who came to the plate never scored.
Wade Grenville, the first man up, got a clean single.
Jed Stafford, next man in line, banged out
an amazingly long fly that looked as if it was
worth three bases anyway, but Freeman traveled
back and stabbed it with one hand, bringing forth
a wild round of applause and cheers from the
rooters of both sides, for it was a wonderful
catch. Wade managed to get to second on the
throw in.</p>

<p>Jeff Thatcher was the next batter up and he
too found Wells for a smashing drive that was
picked up by Southers and shot down to third in
time to cut the flying Wade off. Dick Leslie tried
to double by catching Jeff before he made first,
but Jeff beat the ball to the bag by more than a
yard and was safe. There were two down, a man
on first, and Buck Hart up. Buck Hart had made
a hit before in the game and Wells was very cautious
with him. Indeed he showed his head work
by passing Buck to first and moving Jeff on to
second, for he realized that the next man up was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Honey Wiggins, the pitcher, and he was more
willing to take a chance with Honey’s hitting
ability than he was with Buck’s bit stick. With
two men on and a single needed to bring in a run
the Pennington stands went wild yelling for a
single.</p>

<p>Honey looked desperate as he faced the Lawrencetown
pitcher, but Wells, as cool as could be
under the pressure of excitement, never wavered.
He paid no attention to the men on base, and
pitched to the batter as if he were the only man
in the game. He put a perfect strike over for
the first ball. Then Honey drew two balls in succession
and another strike. With two and two,
Wells tried to put over the third and final ball,
but Honey saw how good it was and slammed at it.
It was a beautiful line drive toward second and it
certainly looked as if Honey had succeeded in
poking out the necessary hit to score Thatcher.
Jeff and Buck, running on anything, tore around
the bases madly, but as Jeff rounded third he
heard the plunk of ball against leather and he
turned his head in time to see Southers coming
down from a remarkable jump. He had made
a wonderful catch and shut off the chance that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
Pennington had to add at least one more run to
its advantage. The side was retired, but the score
still stood 2 to 1 in Pennington’s favor in the beginning
of the ninth.</p>

<p>With one frame left in which to do or die, the
Lawrencetown players came in from the field all
set to break things wide open. It was a fighting
team, and a ninth inning situation of this sort was
not new to them. They had played through more
than one of them and made good during the season
and they were determined to do it once again.
The Lawrencetown stands started up a volume of
cheering that surpassed anything in that line they
had done so far during the game. The band
opened up with all the brass it had, too, and the
team, on its toes, began a line of coaching that
indicated all too plainly to the Pennington team
out in the field that the Lawrencetown boys were
far from accepting the defeat that was staring
them in the face. Their fighting spirit had only
just been aroused to its full pitch and the buff and
blue players knew that this was to be the really
big Lawrencetown inning of the game.</p>

<p>All this by way of preliminary may have worked
a little under the skin of Honey Wiggins, for with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the first ball he pitched it was evident to Jeff on
third and to several other players, as well as Captain
Tad, that he was a little unsteady.</p>

<p>The catcher walked out to the box with the ball
and gave him a word of encouragement, and Jeff
from third yelled: “Steady, old boy. Don’t let
this thing get on your nerve. We’ve got ’em
beaten. Let’s hold ’em down this one session and
it’s all over but the shouting.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’em where we want ’em. Steady,
boy,” called Buck Hart as he spat on his glove
and settled down to play short.</p>

<p>Southers, the head of the Lawrencetown batting
order, was up. With one ball to his credit,
he stood there grinning at Honey Wiggins, who,
very deliberate in all his movements now, was
striving to settle his jumping nerves. He wound
up for the second ball and delivered it, a perfect
strike. But Southers refused to let it be called
a strike and landed on it for a clean single into
right field.</p>

<p>The Lawrencetown stand went wild and so did
the team. With a man on and none out and the
opposing pitcher visibly nervous, things certainly
began to look brighter. The heavy artillery was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
up, too, and as Wild, one of their big guns, stepped
up to the rubber, the crowd began to storm for
a hit.</p>

<p>And Wild got it; a clean single almost in the
same place where Southers had placed his ball.
Southers went down to second and Wild was
safe on first, and there were none out. Freeman,
the heaviest slugger of the Lawrencetown team,
was the next man at bat. Things certainly did
look serious for the Pennington team and bright
and cheerful for the visitors.</p>

<p>When Honey Wiggins saw Freeman step to the
plate he seemed to take a long time to think things
over. He certainly was in a hole. Whether to
pitch to Freeman and take a chance or whether to
pass him was the question that seemed to trouble
him. Finally he appeared to decide on the latter
course, for he was very careful to keep the ball
out of reach of the heavy hitter’s stick, and presently
the umpire called:</p>

<p>“Ball four.”</p>

<p>Freeman walked to first and the bases were full,
with none out!</p>

<p>The stands shook under the wild behavior and
ceaseless cheering of the Lawrencetown contingent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
for they realized only too well that a single
would sew up the game for them. “A hit!
A hit! Just one little safe bingle!” roared the
crowd.</p>

<p>Oleson was up. Oleson, the only man to score
for Lawrencetown so far that day. His name
pealed forth in a roaring cheer as he took his
place at the plate.</p>

<p>Honey Wiggins was in a worse predicament
than he had been during the entire game, and his
nerves were all gone, that was evident. Already
Coach Rice had Cy Gordon warming up, and
Honey looked appealingly toward the bench, as if
he hoped that the coach would “derrick” him
from the mound and take him out of his mighty
unpleasant position.</p>

<p>But the coach motioned him to continue with
the game, and Honey, to steady himself, tried three
times to catch the runner off of first.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jeff Thatcher, on third, all on edge
himself, was watching the batter and the Lawrencetown
bench, where their coach sat. He saw
signals passed, and while he could not read them,
he concluded that Oleson had been instructed to
do the obvious thing: try a squeeze play in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
hope of bringing in the necessary run to tie and
still leave runners in a position to score.</p>

<p>Honey Wiggins evidently guessed the play, too,
and so did others on the team, for Buck Hart
yelled:</p>

<p>“Come on, Honey, play the batter. On your
toes, every one, and watch out for a hit-and-run
play.”</p>

<p>Honey faced the batter, and as he did so every
runner took a long lead off base. They started
with the snap of Honey’s arm. But Honey, using
his head, did not shoot over a ball that was good
for a clean hit. It was high and swift, and Oleson,
doubtless nervous himself, and knowing that he
had to play the first ball, took a short, snappy
swing at it. He connected. There was a report
and a flash of white in the air in the direction of
third base.</p>

<p>Jeff, on his toes, close to his bag, saw what had
happened. He saw the white sphere coming toward
him four feet above his head. It was a safe
drive if it got by him, and it surely looked as if
it would. All three men on base were moving
under full steam and Oleson was sprinting toward
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p><a href="#i_fp282">With a terrific jump Jeff shot up in the air</a> and
stuck out his gloved hand. There was a thump of
ball against leather and Jeff, clinging to the
sphere, dropped to the bag, then stepping out
quickly, tagged the runner who was coming full
speed down from second.</p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_282">With a terrific jump Jeff shot up in the air</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then in the most matter-of-fact way he tossed
the ball to Honey Wiggins and began to trot toward
the bench.</p>

<p>For a moment absolute silence settled over the
field. No one save Jeff seemed to realize what
had happened.</p>

<p>“Man’s out—two out—<em>three out</em>!” called the
umpire, after a moment’s puzzled study.</p>

<p>Then, as the crowd heard his decisions and realized
what Thatcher, the third baseman, had accomplished,
a cheer started that gathered and
gathered in volume until it mounted skyward like
a peal of thunder.</p>

<p>Unassisted Jeff had made a triple play!<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> A play of this sort took place in the World’s Series of 1920
between the Brooklyn and Cleveland team when the Cleveland
second baseman made a triple play unassisted. It was the first
play of its kind ever recorded in a World’s Series and only the
fourth on record in the history of the national game.</p>

</div>

<p>His brilliant catch of Oleson’s fly had put the
batter out, and as he dropped to third and touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the bag, automatically Southers, who had left for
home, also went out, and Wild, romping down
from second, had been tagged out within five feet
of third base, thus putting out the entire side in
a single play and bringing to naught the most
critical situation that the Pennington team had
been in during the entire game.</p>

<p>Nothing as scintillating as this in the way of
baseball had ever occurred at Pennington, or at
Lawrencetown, either, for that matter, and the
crowd went wild over Jeff.</p>

<p>His team mates, coming in from the field, literally
mobbed him, and picking him up bodily,
carried him on their shoulders toward the player’s
bench, much to Jeff’s embarrassment. Then they
started on a parade around the diamond, for the
game had ended there, the score still 2 to 1 in
Pennington’s favor, so it was not necessary to
play the last half of the ninth inning.</p>

<p>The student body, led by the blaring band, fell
in behind the triumphal procession of players,
with Thatcher on their shoulders, and round and
round the diamond they went in a wild snake
dance that finally worked its way off the field and
over to the gymnasium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>There, as the players mounted the steps, Jeff
was cheered and cheered again, and then in a
brief lull in the noise some one shouted from the
crowd:</p>

<p>“Oh, you Third Base Thatcher. Won’t the
girls be wild about you at the ‘hop’ to-night!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Jeff colored up like a turkey gobbler,
and breaking away from the crowd, bolted
into the gymnasium building and dashed down
stairs to the locker room, while the rest of the
joyous, grinning players streamed down the stairs
after him, laughing and joking at his consternation.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
